# ORCA — Phase Implementation History

**Purpose:** This file contains the detailed implementation narratives for all completed phases (1–36) and git commit logs. It is the historical record of how Orca was built. For the active technical reference (schema, API, architecture decisions, current roadmap), see `ORCA_STATUS.md`.

**Note:** This file is NOT imported by CLAUDE.md and is not loaded into Claude Code's context. It is used in Claude.ai planning sessions when historical context about a specific phase is needed.

## Completed Phase Narratives (Phases 1–30)

## Current Feature Status

### ✅ Completed (MVP - Phase 1)

- **User Authentication**
  - Registration with username, email, password
  - Login with JWT tokens
  - Protected routes
  - Auth context for global state

- **Root Concepts**
  - View all root concepts
  - Create new root concepts
  - Display child count on concept cards

- **Hierarchical Navigation**
  - Click into concepts to view children
  - Breadcrumb navigation with concept names
  - Breadcrumb tooltips for long names
  - Path-based routing with query parameters

- **Context-Aware Children**
  - Each concept can have different children depending on parent path
  - Graph path stored as PostgreSQL array
  - Cycle prevention (concept can't appear twice in same graph)

- **Voting System (Saves)**
  - Save child concepts (vote)
  - Save counts displayed
  - Visual indication of user's saves
  - Children sorted by save count
  - Save removal

- **Concept Reuse**
  - Same concept can exist in multiple graphs
  - Creating child checks if concept name exists (case-insensitive)
  - Reuses existing concept if found

### ✅ Completed (Phase 2)

- **Flip View**
  - Backend endpoint to get all parent contexts for a concept
  - FlipView component displays all parent contexts as cards in a grid layout
  - Toggle button in header to switch between children view and flip view
  - Two modes: contextual (with back button) and exploratory (for future search)
  - Shows save counts per parent context (inline next to parent name)
  - Shows "Saved" badge when user has saved that edge
  - Click parent card to navigate to that concept in that graph context
  - Full path displayed on hover tooltip for any parent card

- **Flip View Card Display**
  - Each parent context rendered as an individual card in a flat grid, sorted by save count descending (from backend query)
  - Each card shows: path above the immediate parent (italic, smaller text), then the immediate parent name (black, larger text), save count, and saved badge
  - Root-level parents (nothing above them) show only the parent name — no redundant path text
  - Full path displayed on hover tooltip for any card
  - Concept names for path segments resolved via existing `getConceptNames` batch endpoint

- **Display Totals**
  - Root page displays total registered users at the top (Note: Phase 8 dormancy operates at the save-vote level, not user-level — dormant users' votes are excluded from counts but the total user count is unaffected)
  - Concept view displays the current concept's save total next to the concept name (edge save count in current path context)
  - Works for both root concepts (via root edge lookup) and non-root concepts (via parent edge lookup)
  - Root concepts sorted by save count descending on root page

- **Root Concept Voting (Saves)**
  - Root concepts now have edges (`parent_id = NULL`, `graph_path = '{}'`) created automatically when a root concept is created
  - Saves attach to root edges the same as any other edge — unified save model
  - Root page ConceptGrid shows save buttons and counts, same as concept child views
  - Existing root concepts without edges need backfilling (see SQL in Known Technical Issues)

- **Browser Back Button Integration**
  - Flip View state is stored in the URL as `&view=flip` query parameter instead of React state
  - Toggling Flip View pushes a new browser history entry via `navigate()`
  - Browser back button naturally returns from Flip View to children view
  - FlipView "Back" button uses `navigate(-1)` for consistent behavior
  - Flip View state survives page refresh (URL preserves the view mode)

- **Combined Add/Search Field**
  - Persistent `SearchField.jsx` component fixed at bottom-right of both Root and Concept pages
  - Placeholder text: "Add / Search..."
  - Debounced input (300ms) triggers `GET /api/concepts/search` endpoint
  - Two-tier matching via pg_trgm: exact/substring matches shown first, then trigram similarity matches labeled with "similar" badge
  - Results that are already children in the current context show a "child" badge
  - Clicking any search result navigates to decontextualized Flip View (`/concept/{id}?view=flip`)
  - On concept pages (children view only): "Add [name] as child" option appears at top of dropdown when typed text isn't already a child
  - On root page: "Create [name] as root concept" option appears when typed text doesn't match any existing concept
  - Replaces the old floating `+ Add Child Concept` and `+ Add Root Concept` buttons
  - Dropdown closes on Escape key or clicking outside
  - pg_trgm extension required (one-time `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm` on database)
  - GIN trigram index on `concepts.name` for fast fuzzy search

---

## Known Bugs

### Fixed
- ✅ Breadcrumb navigation (immediate parent click works now)
- ✅ Breadcrumb concept names (shows names instead of IDs)
- ✅ Child count on concept cards
- ✅ Flip View path grouping trie algorithm was buggy (divergence at trie root collapsed all parents into a single ungrouped set). Resolved by removing trie entirely in favor of flat vote-sorted cards — simpler and better UX.
- ✅ Decontextualized Flip View (via search) incorrectly showed breadcrumb, Children View toggle button, and hid the Back button. Fix: detect decontextualized mode when URL has `view=flip` but no `path` param. In this mode, breadcrumb is replaced with a simple title (`"ConceptName — all parent contexts"`), the toggle button is hidden, and the Back button in FlipView.jsx now shows in both `contextual` and `exploratory` modes (changed from `mode === 'contextual' && onBack` to just `onBack`).

### Current
- None reported ✅

### Fixed (Phase 17 — via Claude Code)
- ✅ **Subscribed corpus tabs disappear from sidebar after auto-grouping.** `handleOpenConceptTab` auto-groups corpus tabs with spawned concept tabs (sets `group_id`). `ungroupedCorpusTabs` filtered these out, and `renderSidebarGroup` only rendered `graphTabs` — grouped corpus tabs vanished. Additionally, `renderSidebarCorpusItem` used `depth === 0` as proxy for "is subscribed", breaking at `depth=1` inside a group. Fix: `renderSidebarGroup` now renders both corpus and graph members. Replaced `depth === 0` with `corpusTabs.some(t => t.id === tab.id)`. Added overlay-clearing (`setCorpusView(null)`, `setSavedPageOpen(false)`) to corpus tab click. **Learning:** Never use render depth as proxy for semantic identity — use the authoritative data source. See Architecture Decisions #147, #150.
- ✅ **"Subscribe to top-level corpus" error when opening documents from sub-corpus browse.** `onOpenDocument` from `CorpusDetailView` passed the sub-corpus ID to `handleSubscribeToCorpus`. Backend correctly rejects subscribe for sub-corpuses. Fix: `CorpusDetailView` passes `parent_corpus_id`. AppShell walks up parent chain to find top-level corpus, with short-circuit against `corpusTabs`. Error fallback returns early. **Learning:** Async fallback paths must abort, not proceed with invalid inputs. See Architecture Decision #148.
- ✅ **Graph tab click does nothing while corpus browse overlay is open.** `renderSidebarGraphItem` onClick only called `setActiveTab` without clearing `corpusView`. Fix: added `setCorpusView(null)` and `setSavedPageOpen(false)`. **Learning:** Three mutually exclusive content areas must be explicitly managed on every navigation action. See Architecture Decision #146.
- ✅ **CorpusDetailView missing version/draft badges on document cards.** Simpler template than `CorpusTabContent`. Fix: added version badge, draft badge, dashed border for drafts. **Learning:** Both document card views must stay in sync. See Architecture Decision #149.
- ✅ **CorpusDetailView missing tag pills on document cards.** Backend returned tags but view never rendered them. Fix: added tag pill display.
- ✅ **No tag filtering in WebLinksView Document Annotations.** Tags showed as read-only pills but couldn't filter. Fix: added `annotationTagFilter` state, filter bar, and corpus/document-level filtering logic.

### Fixed (Phase 7h/7i)
- ✅ **Version creation failed with "Document not found in this corpus" when creating from version history.** When viewing a document version reached via version history in a corpus tab, and the version was only in a different corpus, `createVersion` rejected the request because it required the source document to be in the current corpus. Fix: `createVersion` now only checks that the document exists (not that it's in the requesting corpus). The new version is auto-added to ALL corpuses the source document belongs to, plus the current corpus.
- ✅ **New document versions only added to the requesting corpus.** When a document existed in multiple corpuses, creating a new version only added it to the corpus the user was currently in. Fix: `createVersion` now queries `corpus_documents` for all corpuses the source belongs to and adds the new version to all of them via `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.
- ✅ **Concept link click opened children view instead of decontextualized Flip View.** `handleOpenConceptTab` in AppShell had `view_mode` hardcoded to `'children'`. Fix: added optional 6th `viewMode` parameter. Additionally, the wrapper arrow function on `CorpusTabContent`'s `onOpenConceptTab` prop (line 909 in AppShell) was only destructuring 4 parameters, silently dropping the `viewMode` argument. Fix: wrapper now passes `viewMode` through. **Learning:** When wrapping callbacks with arrow functions to inject extra parameters (like `sourceCorpusTabId`), always pass through all remaining parameters to avoid silently dropping new ones added later.

### Fixed (Phase 7d-3/4)
- ✅ **Annotations not visible when opening documents from Corpuses overlay.** The Corpuses button (📚) in the header opens a browsing overlay that uses `CorpusDetailView` → `DocumentView`. The `DocumentView` component was built in Phase 7a as a basic text viewer with zero annotation support — annotations were only added to `CorpusTabContent` (corpus tab document viewer) in Phase 7d-2. Fix: clicking a document in `CorpusDetailView` now subscribes to the corpus (if needed), switches to the corpus tab, and auto-opens the document there via `pendingDocumentId`. The `DocumentView` overlay is no longer used for document opens from the corpus detail view. **Learning:** Two separate document viewing paths existed (overlay `DocumentView` vs tab `CorpusTabContent`). All document viewing should go through `CorpusTabContent` to ensure annotation support.
- ✅ **Annotations sometimes missing on first document visit (race condition).** In `CorpusTabContent.handleOpenDocument`, `loadAnnotations(docId)` was called but not awaited. The `finally` block set `docLoading = false` before annotations finished loading, so the document sometimes rendered with an empty annotation array on first view. Fix: `await loadAnnotations(docId)` so the document and annotations both load before the loading spinner disappears.
- ✅ **Clicking a document name in External Links page opened the corpus tab but not the document.** Both corpus name and document name clicks called the same `handleCorpusClick` which only subscribed/switched to the corpus tab's document list. Fix: document title click now passes `doc.documentId` to `onOpenCorpusTab(corpusId, corpusName, documentId)`, and the `pendingDocumentId` mechanism auto-opens that document in the corpus tab.

### Fixed (Phase 7b misc)
- ✅ **Stray `}` in Concept.jsx (line 889)** caused Vite warning: `The character "}" is not valid inside a JSX element`. Extra closing brace after `FlipView` conditional render block. Fixed by removing the extra `}`. Harmless warning (app still ran) but cleaned up for correctness.

### Fixed (Phase 7d)
- ✅ **`document` variable shadowing in CorpusTabContent.jsx:** React state variable named `document` (the Orca document object) shadowed the browser's global `document`. Calling `document.createRange()` in `getTextOffsetInElement` failed with "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'createRange')" because it was calling `.createRange()` on the React state (null or a plain object), not the browser DOM. Fix: use `window.document.createRange()`.
- ✅ **`getConceptNames` response format mismatch in AnnotationPanel and CorpusTabContent:** The `getConceptNames` batch endpoint returns `{ concepts: [{ id, name }, ...] }` (array of objects), but the code was treating the response as `{ names: { id: name } }` (a direct ID→name lookup map). This caused all ancestor path names to render as `#1`, `#2`, etc. (the fallback for missing names). Fix: convert the concepts array into a proper `{ id: name }` lookup map before using it.

### Fixed (Phase 5 misc)
- ✅ **FlipView alt parent click did not navigate in tab mode (pre-existing from Phase 5c).** `FlipView.handleParentClick` used URL-based `navigate()` to go to `/concept/{id}?path=...`, but since Phase 5c everything runs inside AppShell's tab system — URL navigation doesn't update the active graph tab. Fix: `Concept.jsx` now passes an `onParentClick` callback to `FlipView.jsx` which calls `navigateInTab()` for proper in-tab navigation with nav history support. Falls back to URL navigation in standalone mode.
- ✅ **SearchField showed "child:undefined" badges (pre-existing).** The `childAttributes` array from the backend contains raw strings (e.g., `"action"`) but `SearchField.jsx` was treating them as objects with `.attribute_name` property. Fix: handle both string and object formats with `typeof a === 'string' ? a : a.attribute_name`.

### Fixed (Phase 5c)
- ✅ **Clicking a root concept only updated the tab label but didn't navigate into it.** Root was sending `tabType`/`conceptId` (camelCase) via `onNavigate`, but AppShell was spreading those directly onto tab objects and then checking `tab.tab_type`/`tab.concept_id` (snake_case) — so the render condition never changed. Fix: `handleGraphTabNavigate` in AppShell now normalizes camelCase keys to snake_case before applying to local state.
- ✅ **Nav history was lost when switching tabs.** AppShell was rendering only the active graph tab, so inactive tabs unmounted and lost their `navHistory` state. Fix: all graph tabs are now rendered simultaneously; inactive ones are hidden with `display: none` (hide-not-unmount).
- ✅ **Concept component remounted on every within-tab navigation**, wiping `navHistory`. The `key` prop on `<Concept>` included `concept_id` and `path`, causing a full remount on each navigation. Fix: key is now just `graph-${tab.id}`.
- ✅ **Back button didn't appear after searching from root page.** When a search result was clicked from root, AppShell switched from rendering Root to Concept (fresh mount), so `navHistory` started empty and the back button was hidden. Fix: `navHistory` is initialized with a root entry when Concept mounts with `initialViewMode === 'flip'` and no path.
- ✅ **Tab label didn't update to "Root" when navigating back to root.** `navigateBack` wasn't sending a `label` field when popping back to a root entry. Fix: `navigateBack` now sends `label: 'Root'` when `prev.conceptId` is null.
- ✅ **Closing the last graph tab created two Root tabs.** `createDefaultGraphTab` used `setGraphTabs(prev => [...prev, newTab])`, but `prev` still contained the stale (just-deleted) tab due to React's batched state updates. Fix: use `setGraphTabs([newTab])` to replace the array entirely since we know all graph tabs are gone.
- ✅ **"Open in new window" for saved tabs pointed to a non-existent `/saved-standalone` route.** Fix: removed the option from saved tab context menu; saved tabs now show only "Remove tab and unsave concepts" (when 2+ exist) or "No actions available" (last tab).

### Fixed (Phase 20)
- ✅ **Duplicate concept names in annotation path display in `DecontextualizedDocView.jsx`.** `graph_path` already includes the parent concept ID as its last element, so `ancestorNames` already contained the parent name — but the code was pushing `parentName` again, doubling it. Fix: removed the extra `push` of `parentName`/`parent_id` on lines 85–90. Same bug had been fixed earlier in `CorpusTabContent.jsx` but not in the decontextualized view.

### ✅ Completed (Phase 3)

- **Attribute System**
  - `attributes` table with four seeded values: action, tool, value, question
  - `attribute_id` column added to `edges` (NOT NULL, with foreign key to attributes)
  - All existing edges migrated to `[action]` attribute
  - Unique constraint updated to include attribute: `UNIQUE(parent_id, child_id, graph_path, attribute_id)`
  - New API endpoint: `GET /api/concepts/attributes` returns available attributes
  - `getConceptWithChildren` returns `currentAttribute` (attribute of the concept in its current path context)
  - All queries (children, parents, root concepts) return `attribute_id` and `attribute_name`
  - Search results include `childAttributes` array showing which attributes a concept already has in the current context

- **Attribute Display (Square Brackets Everywhere)**
  - ConceptGrid cards show `Name [attribute]` for every concept
  - Concept page header shows `Name [attribute]` with attribute in gray
  - Breadcrumb shows `[attribute]` on the current concept
  - Flip View parent cards show `[attribute]` after parent name
  - Search results show which attribute(s) a child already has (e.g., "child: [action]")

- **Two-Step Creation Flow with Attribute Picker**
  - Creating a concept (root or child) is now two steps: (1) click add/create, (2) pick attribute
  - Four attribute buttons appear in the search dropdown: `[action]`, `[tool]`, `[value]`, `[question]`
  - Both "Add as child" and "Create as root concept" flows use the same picker
  - Backend validates `attributeId` is required and exists

- **255-Character Name Validation**
  - `maxLength={255}` on SearchField input prevents typing beyond limit
  - Backend validates name length and returns error if > 255 characters
  - Database column `VARCHAR(255)` enforces at storage level

- **Migration Safety**
  - `migrate.js` uses IF NOT EXISTS checks throughout — safe to re-run
  - Backfill query only updates edges where `attribute_id IS NULL`
  - Old unique constraint dropped only if it exists; new constraint added only if it doesn't

---

### ✅ Completed (Phase 4)

The following Phase 4 features have been implemented.

- **Full-Path Save Model (No Double Counting)**
  - Saving a concept saves the full path above it — every edge from root to the saved concept gets one save from that user
  - Save count on any edge = number of distinct users who have that edge as part of their saved tree
  - **No double counting:** Each user contributes at most 1 save per edge, regardless of how many branches below it they've saved
  - Uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to skip existing votes when saving path edges
  - Save totals always reflect what users see on their Saved Pages — no gaps, full context preserved

- **Cascading Unsave**
  - Unsaving a concept removes saves from that edge AND all descendant edges in that branch
  - Uses PostgreSQL array prefix matching (`graph_path[1:N] = prefix`) to find all descendant edges
  - Handles both root edges and non-root edges correctly when computing descendant paths
  - Save counts on all affected edges are subtracted accordingly

- **Sort Selector (Graph Votes / Newest / Annotations / Top Annotation) — Phase 29c flat row**
  - Available on both Root page and Concept page (children view)
  - **Flat horizontal toggle row** (replaced `<select>` dropdown in Phase 29c) matching the annotation filter style (All | Corpus Members | Author) from CorpusTabContent
  - Four options displayed inline: **Graph Votes | Newest | Annotations | Top Annotation**
  - Active state: #333 background with white text; inactive: white background with #888 text
  - `borderRight: 1px solid #eee` dividers between buttons, outer `border: 1px solid #ddd` with `borderRadius: 4px`
  - Styles: `sortRow`, `sortBtn`, `sortBtnActive` (replaced old `sortSelect`/`sortSelectActive`)
  - Backend accepts optional `sort=new`, `sort=annotations`, or `sort=top_annotation` query parameter on both `/root` and `/:id` endpoints
  - Secondary sort key for saves and new: concept name (alphabetical); for annotations: save count descending then concept name; for top annotation: save count descending then concept name
  - **Sort by Annotations (Phase 11):** Counts distinct documents (across all corpuses) where the child concept appears as an annotation via `document_annotations`. Conditional `LEFT JOIN document_annotations` and `COUNT(DISTINCT da.document_id)` only added when `sort=annotations` to avoid unnecessary join overhead on default queries.
  - **Sort by Top Annotation (Phase 29b):** Uses a `LEFT JOIN LATERAL` subquery to find all annotations on each child's edge via `document_annotations`, count votes per annotation via `annotation_votes`, and take the `MAX` vote count. Returns `top_annotation_votes` in the response. Children with no annotations get `top_annotation_votes = 0` and sort to the bottom. Conditional join pattern matches the existing `sort=annotations` approach. When active, `ConceptGrid.jsx` displays a subtle "Top annotation: N votes" indicator on each child card (only when value > 0).

- **Link Votes (Similarity Votes) — Flip View Only**
  - Available only in contextual Flip View (entered from a specific path)
  - User votes that a parent context is "linked" or helpful relative to the origin context
  - Context-specific: different origin contexts have independent link vote sets
  - Not shown in decontextualized Flip View (from search)
  - **Flip View sorting:** Primary sort is by link vote count (descending). Tiebreaker is the current concept's save count in that parent context (but save count is NOT displayed on the card — it's a hidden tiebreaker). This means Flip View is useful from day one (falls back to save-count ordering when link votes are sparse) and gets better as people use link votes.
  - The origin edge's own card is filtered out in contextual mode (user is already there)
  - 🔗 button on each card toggles link vote; "Linked" badge shows when user has voted
  - Validation prevents linking an edge to itself
  - Verifies both edges exist before creating a link vote

- **Flip View Similarity Percentage (Contextual Mode Only)**
  - In contextual Flip View, each alternative parent card displays a **similarity percentage** comparing direct children
  - Formula: `shared children count / total unique children across both contexts` (Jaccard similarity)
  - Does NOT recurse into subchildren — compares direct children only
  - Displayed at the bottom-right of each alt parent card, next to the link vote section
  - Returns `null` (no display) when both contexts have 0 children
  - **Sort toggle button** cycles through three modes: Sort by Links (default) → Sort by Similarity ↓ (highest first) → Sort by Similarity ↑ (lowest first)
  - Backend computes similarity via `Promise.all` over alt parents, querying direct children of the concept in each context
  - Files changed: `conceptsController.js`, `FlipView.jsx`

- **Move Votes (Side Votes)** — ❌ REMOVED (Phase 20b)
  - User flags a concept as belonging in a different context via "→" button on child cards
  - Move button shows total move vote count (distinct users) next to save button
  - Modal opens with two sections: existing move suggestions (with vote counts, second/un-second buttons) and search field
  - Search results show concept matches; clicking one loads all parent contexts (like Flip View cards)
  - Clicking a context opens a mini graph browser where user can navigate freely
  - "Move here" button when concept already exists as a child at the browsed location
  - "Add here & move" combined action (with attribute picker) when concept doesn't exist at the browsed location
  - Creates edge + places move vote in one click
  - Multiple users can place distinct move votes pointing to different destinations
  - Validation prevents moving an edge to itself, verifies both edges exist
  - `side_votes` table with indexes on `edge_id` and `destination_edge_id`
  - `move_count` returned as a subquery in `getConceptWithChildren` (uses `COUNT(DISTINCT sv.user_id)`)
  - Files changed: `migrate.js`, `votesController.js`, `conceptsController.js`, `votes.js` (routes), `api.js`, `ConceptGrid.jsx`, `Concept.jsx`, new `MoveModal.jsx`

- **Swap Votes (Replace Votes)**
  - User flags a concept as "should be replaced by a sibling" via ⇄ button on child cards
  - Swap button shows total swap vote count (distinct users) next to move button: `→3 ⇄2`
  - Modal opens showing two sections: existing swap suggestions (sorted by vote count, with second/un-second buttons) and remaining siblings (with "Swap" button)
  - Siblings are all other children of the same parent in the same graph context (same `parent_id` and `graph_path`)
  - Backend validates sibling relationship before accepting a swap vote — rejects if edges don't share the same parent and path
  - Multiple users can point to different replacement siblings
  - Purely informational — no automatic removal (append-only model)
  - `replace_votes` table with indexes on `edge_id` and `replacement_edge_id`
  - `swap_count` returned as a subquery in `getConceptWithChildren` (uses `COUNT(DISTINCT rv.user_id)`)
  - Files changed: `migrate.js`, `votesController.js`, `conceptsController.js`, `votes.js` (routes), `api.js`, `ConceptGrid.jsx`, `Concept.jsx`, new `SwapModal.jsx`

- **Vote Set Visualization (Layer 1: Swatches + Dots + Basic Filtering)**
  - New backend endpoint: `GET /api/concepts/:id/votesets?path=...` computes identical vote sets
  - SQL uses CTEs: first builds per-user sorted arrays of saved child edge IDs, then groups users by identical arrays
  - **No minimum threshold:** Solo vote sets (1 user) get a color swatch, so a user can always see and interact with their own vote pattern. This was changed in Phase 5f to support child ranking — users need to see their own swatch to rank their children.
  - Returns: `voteSets` (array of sets with setIndex, edgeIds, childIds, userCount, userIds, voteSetKey), `edgeToSets` (lookup mapping each edge_id to its set indices), `userSetIndex` (which set the current user belongs to, or null), and `parentEdgeId` (the edge connecting this concept to its parent, used as context key for child rankings)
  - New `VoteSetBar.jsx` component displays color swatches at top of Concept page between header and children grid
  - Curated 12-color named palette (Indigo, Teal, Crimson, Goldenrod, Forest, Coral, Slate, Sienna, Plum, Steel, Olive, Rose) — only source of color in the UI per design philosophy
  - Each swatch shows user count; tooltip shows color name and set details
  - **User's own swatch** has a bold dark border (`2px solid #333`) and tooltip includes "Your vote set" prefix for easy identification
  - `ConceptGrid.jsx` updated to accept `edgeToSets` prop and render small colored dots in top-right of each child card
  - Dots use the same color palette via shared `getSetColor()` export from VoteSetBar
  - **Basic filtering:** Clicking a swatch filters to show only children in that set. Clicking multiple swatches shows children in ANY selected set, sorted by number of matching sets (descending) then by save count. ✕ button clears all filters.
  - Filter info text shows "Showing X of Y children matching selected patterns"
  - Vote sets re-fetched whenever concept data reloads (after voting, adding children, etc.) and filters clear on reload
  - No database migration required — computed from existing `votes` and `edges` tables
  - Files changed: `conceptsController.js`, `concepts.js` (routes), `api.js`, `ConceptGrid.jsx`, `Concept.jsx`, new `VoteSetBar.jsx`

- **Vote Set Tiered Display (Layer 2: Toggle for Ranked Sections)**
  - When 2+ swatches are selected, a ☰ toggle button appears in VoteSetBar between the swatches and the ✕ clear button
  - **Default off:** Multi-swatch filtering still shows a flat sorted list by default (sorted by match count descending, then saves) — same behavior as Layer 1
  - **Toggle on:** Activates tiered view, splitting filtered children into labeled sections by match count
  - Section headers use italic serif text (e.g., "In all 3 selected patterns", "In 2 of 3", "In 1 of 3")
  - Within each section, children sorted by save count descending
  - Color dots for ALL sets (including non-selected) remain visible on each child card
  - Filter info text appends " · tiered view" when tiered mode is active
  - `ConceptGrid.jsx` updated to accept optional `tierLabel` prop — renders a styled header above the grid when present
  - Tiered view renders multiple `ConceptGrid` instances (one per tier section) vs one for flat view
  - **Smart cleanup:** Tiered view auto-disables when active sets drop below 2 (via deselecting swatches), and resets when data reloads or filters are cleared
  - ☰ button styling matches Sort by New toggle: dark background when active (#333), light when inactive
  - No backend changes or database migration required — purely frontend logic
  - Files changed: `VoteSetBar.jsx`, `ConceptGrid.jsx`, `Concept.jsx`

- **Vote Set Similarity Grouping (Layer 3: Super-Groups via Hierarchical Clustering)**
  - Backend: `getVoteSets` endpoint now computes super-groups after building individual vote sets
  - **Clustering algorithm:** Agglomerative hierarchical clustering with average-link similarity. Pairwise Jaccard similarity computed between all vote sets' edge ID arrays. Clusters merged iteratively when average inter-cluster similarity exceeds threshold. Deterministic (no randomness) — same input always produces same groups.
  - **Similarity threshold:** 0.5 (50% Jaccard overlap). Two vote sets sharing half or more of their children (by edge ID) get merged into the same super-group. Tunable if needed.
  - **Response shape expanded:** `/votesets` endpoint now returns `superGroups` (array of groups with groupIndex, setIndices, edgeIds) and `edgeToSuperGroups` (lookup mapping edge_id to group indices) alongside existing `voteSets` and `edgeToSets`
  - **Super-group color:** Blended from the first and last member set colors (RGB average). Named as "FirstColor–LastColor" (e.g., "Indigo–Teal"). Displayed as a thin (14px tall) swatch bar above member swatches.
  - **Visual layout:** `VoteSetBar.jsx` now renders two rows — super-group swatches on top (aligned above their member swatches), individual set swatches on bottom. Ungrouped sets appear first on the left, grouped sets appear together in clusters. A spacer div aligns the super-group row above its member cluster.
  - **Group cluster underline:** Grouped individual swatches are wrapped in a div with a `borderBottom` that becomes visible (in the group's blended color) on hover or when the group is active. Gap between grouped swatches is 4px (tighter than the 8px gap between ungrouped sets) to visually reinforce clustering.
  - **Hover behavior:** Hovering a super-group swatch (or its member cluster) sets `hoveredGroupIndex` state in Concept.jsx, which propagates to all `ConceptGrid` instances. Dots on child cards that belong to ANY set in the hovered group receive a glow effect (`boxShadow`) and scale up to 1.3× via CSS transitions.
  - **Group-level filtering:** Clicking a super-group swatch toggles `activeGroupIndices` in Concept.jsx. Active groups expand into their member setIndices for filtering purposes via `getEffectiveActiveSetIndices()` — a union of directly selected sets plus all sets within active groups. This unified effective set drives both flat and tiered filtering.
  - **Tiered toggle integration:** The ☰ tiered toggle appears when the total active filter count (individual sets + groups) is 2 or more. Tiered sections use the effective set count for "In X of Y" headers. Tiered view auto-disables if total filters drop below 2.
  - **Dimming logic:** When any filter is active, swatches not selected (and not part of an active group) dim to 0.35 opacity. Individual swatches within an active group stay at full opacity even if not individually selected.
  - **Clear all:** The ✕ button clears both `activeSetIndices` and `activeGroupIndices`, resets tiered view, and clears hover state.
  - **No database migration required** — super-groups computed from existing vote set data on each request. Caching is implicit: groups only change when vote sets change, which triggers a re-fetch.
  - Files changed: `conceptsController.js` (backend clustering logic), `VoteSetBar.jsx` (super-group row, group cluster layout, new props), `ConceptGrid.jsx` (hover highlighting on dots, new props), `Concept.jsx` (super-group state, group click/hover handlers, effective set computation)

---

### ✅ Completed (Phase 5a)

- **Basic Saved Page**
  - New page at `/saved` route showing all of the current user's saved concepts organized as collapsible trees
  - Trees are grouped by root concept — each root graph the user has any saves in appears as a card
  - Within each tree, children are nested with indentation and vertical connector lines
  - Children sorted by vote count descending within each tree level
  - Root trees sorted by vote count descending
  - "Saved" button added to the header on both Root page and Concept page for easy navigation

- **Tree Display Features**
  - Clickable concept names navigate to the concept in its full path context (correct `path` query parameter generated from edge's `graphPath`)
  - Attributes displayed in square brackets after each concept name (consistent with rest of app)
  - Vote count shown inline on each node as `▲ N`
  - ~~Move vote indicator shown as `→ N` in amber when move votes exist~~
  - Swap vote indicator shown as `⇄ N` in purple when swap votes exist
  - Collapse/expand toggle (▸/▾) on any node that has children
  - "Collapse All" and "Expand All" toolbar buttons
  - Summary text showing total saved edges and graph count

- **Unsave from Saved Page**
  - ✕ button on every node (including root nodes and leaf nodes)
  - Calls the existing `removeVote` endpoint which cascades to all descendants
  - Page refreshes after unsave to reflect the new state

- **Backend: `GET /api/votes/saved` Endpoint**
  - Returns all edges the current user has voted on, with full details: edge ID, parent ID, child ID, child name, graph path, attribute ID/name, total vote count, swap count
  - Also returns a `conceptNames` lookup (ID → name) for all concepts referenced in paths, avoiding N+1 queries
  - Single query with JOINs to votes, edges, concepts, attributes, plus subqueries for move/swap counts
  - No database migration required — reads entirely from existing tables

- **Known Issue (Resolved):** After adding `Saved.jsx` as a new file, Vite's dev server needs to be restarted (`Ctrl+C` then `npm run dev` in the frontend terminal) for the new file to be picked up. This is a one-time thing per new file addition.

- Files changed: `votesController.js` (new `getUserSaves` endpoint), `votes.js` routes (new `GET /saved` route), `api.js` frontend (new `getUserSaves` method), new `Saved.jsx` page, `App.jsx` (new `/saved` route), `Concept.jsx` (added "Saved" button in header), `Root.jsx` (added "Saved" button in header)

---

### ✅ Completed (Phase 5b)

> ⚠️ **Roadmap note:** The saved tabs system built in Phase 5b (`saved_tabs`, `vote_tab_links`, inline tab picker on save) will be retired when Phase 7c is built. Saved tabs will be replaced by a standalone Saved Page with dynamically generated corpus-based tabs. The implementation below documents what was built and is still running in the current codebase.

- **Saved Tabs**
  - New `saved_tabs` database table storing named tabs per user
  - New `vote_tab_links` junction table linking votes to tabs (many-to-many: a vote can appear in multiple tabs)
  - Default "Saved" tab auto-created for each new user at registration time (in `authController.js`)
  - Migration backfills default tab for all existing users and links all their existing votes to it — seamless upgrade from Phase 5a
  - Tab bar UI on the Saved Page below the header, showing all user's tabs with active tab highlighted via bottom border
  - Click a tab to switch — each tab loads its own tree of saves independently
  - Double-click a tab name to rename it inline (press Enter to confirm, Escape to cancel)
  - `+` button at end of tab bar opens an inline input to create a new tab
  - `✕` button appears on the active tab (only when user has 2+ tabs) to delete it
  - Deleting a tab removes vote-tab links; votes that lose their last link are cleaned up (fully deleted)
  - Cannot delete the last remaining tab — backend enforces this

- **Tab-Aware Saving (▲ Button Tab Picker)**
  - When a user has multiple tabs and clicks ▲ to save a concept, a small inline dropdown appears above the button showing "Save to:" with all tab names
  - Clicking a tab name in the dropdown saves to that tab and closes the picker
  - When the user has only one tab, clicking ▲ saves directly to it (no picker shown)
  - Unsaving from the Saved Page removes from the active tab only (`removeVoteFromTab` endpoint); if the vote isn't linked to any other tab, it's fully deleted
  - Regular unsave (from concept children view) still fully deletes the vote and all its tab links

- **Backend: Tab CRUD Endpoints**
  - `GET /api/votes/tabs` — returns user's tabs ordered by `display_order`
  - `POST /api/votes/tabs/create` — creates a new tab with auto-incremented display_order
  - `POST /api/votes/tabs/rename` — renames a tab (validates ownership)
  - `POST /api/votes/tabs/delete` — deletes a tab (must have 2+), cleans up orphaned votes
  - `POST /api/votes/remove-from-tab` — removes a save from a specific tab, cascading to descendants; deletes vote if no tab links remain
  - `GET /api/votes/saved?tabId=N` — filters saved edges to a specific tab via `vote_tab_links` JOIN
  - `POST /api/votes/add` — now accepts optional `tabId` parameter; defaults to user's first tab

- **Architecture: Junction Table Model**
  - Votes remain unique per `(user_id, edge_id)` — a vote is a user's endorsement of an edge
  - `vote_tab_links` is purely organizational — it says which tabs a vote appears in
  - Save counts visible to other users (`COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)`) are completely unaffected by tabs
  - This separation means tabs are a personal organizational tool that doesn't interfere with the collaborative voting system

- Files changed: `migrate.js` (new `saved_tabs` + `vote_tab_links` tables with backfill), `authController.js` (auto-create default tab on registration), `votesController.js` (tab CRUD endpoints, `removeVoteFromTab`, `tabId` on `addVote`, tab-filtered `getUserSaves`), `votes.js` routes (new tab routes + `remove-from-tab`), `api.js` frontend (new tab API methods, `tabId` on `addVote`), `Saved.jsx` (tab bar UI with switch/create/rename/delete, per-tab loading), `ConceptGrid.jsx` (inline tab picker dropdown on ▲ button), `Concept.jsx` (loads user tabs, passes to ConceptGrid, passes `tabId` on vote), `Root.jsx` (same tab support)

---

### ✅ Completed (Phase 5c-1) — Unified Tab Bar Shell

- **AppShell Architecture**
  - New `AppShell.jsx` component wraps the entire authenticated app
  - Single header with app title ("orca"), username, and logout button
  - Unified tab bar below the header containing both Saved tabs and graph tabs
  - All authenticated routes now go through AppShell (no more separate `/`, `/concept/:id`, `/saved` routes)
  - `App.jsx` simplified to: login, register, and `/*` → AppShell

- **Unified Tab Bar Layout**
  - Saved tabs appear on the left (in italic), graph tabs on the right, separated by a thin vertical divider
  - Active tab highlighted with bold text and bottom border
  - "+" button after Saved tabs creates a new named Saved tab (inline input)
  - "+" button after graph tabs opens a new Root graph tab
  - Graph tabs show an ✕ close button; Saved tabs do NOT (deliberate safety — see below)

- **Saved Tab Safety**
  - Saved tabs no longer have a simple ✕ to delete — this was too easy to accidentally unsave all concepts
  - Instead: right-click a saved tab → context menu → "Remove tab and unsave concepts" (with confirmation dialog)
  - Saved tabs can still be renamed via double-click (same as Phase 5b)
  - At least one saved tab must always exist (backend enforces this)

- **Graph Tabs (Persistent)**
  - New `graph_tabs` database table stores each user's open graph tabs with full navigation state
  - Fields: `tab_type` (root/concept), `concept_id`, `path`, `view_mode`, `label`, `display_order`
  - Graph tabs persist across sessions — survive page refresh and logout/login
  - Backend CRUD endpoints: `GET /votes/graph-tabs`, `POST graph-tabs/create`, `POST graph-tabs/update`, `POST graph-tabs/close`
  - Frontend API methods: `getGraphTabs()`, `createGraphTab()`, `updateGraphTab()`, `closeGraphTab()`

- **Right-Click Context Menu**
  - Right-click any tab (Saved or graph) to see a context menu
  - Graph tab options: "Duplicate tab", "Open in new window", "Close tab"
  - Saved tab options: "Remove tab and unsave concepts" (only when 2+ saved tabs); shows "No actions available" when only one saved tab remains
  - Context menu closes on click outside
  - Context menu position clamped to viewport to prevent off-screen overflow

- **Root.jsx & Concept.jsx Refactored for Tab Mode**
  - Both components now accept optional props: `graphTabId`, `onNavigate`, `savedTabs`, etc.
  - When `graphTabId` is provided (tab mode), navigation happens within the tab rather than via URL changes
  - Concept.jsx maintains a `navHistory` stack for in-tab back button functionality
  - Headers removed from Root.jsx and Concept.jsx — AppShell provides the single header
  - Concept.jsx has a breadcrumb sub-header bar for path navigation + flip view toggle

- **SavedTabContent.jsx (New Component)**
  - Extracted from `Saved.jsx` — renders the tree display for a single saved tab
  - Clicking a concept in the tree calls `onOpenConceptTab()` which opens a new graph tab (instead of navigating away)
  - No header — content renders directly inside AppShell's content area

- Files changed: `migrate.js` (new `graph_tabs` table), `votesController.js` (graph tab CRUD: getGraphTabs, createGraphTab, updateGraphTab, closeGraphTab), `votes.js` routes (4 new graph-tab routes), `api.js` frontend (4 new graph-tab API methods), new `AppShell.jsx`, new `SavedTabContent.jsx`, `App.jsx` (simplified routing), `Root.jsx` (removed header, accepts tab props), `Concept.jsx` (removed header, accepts tab props, navHistory for in-tab back)

---

### ✅ Completed (Phase 5c-4) — Polish & Edge Cases

- **Adjacent-Tab Switching on Close (Chrome-Style)**
  - When closing the active graph tab, focus moves to the tab that was to the right of the closed tab
  - If the closed tab was the rightmost, focus moves to the tab to the left
  - Uses `Math.min(closedIndex, remaining.length - 1)` for index calculation

- **Auto-Create Root Tab on Last Close**
  - Closing the last remaining graph tab automatically creates a fresh "Root" graph tab
  - Prevents user from being stuck with no graph tabs open
  - Uses `setGraphTabs([newTab])` (replace, not append) to avoid React stale-state duplication bug
  - Falls back to first saved tab if auto-create fails

- **Context Menu Overflow Protection**
  - Context menu position clamped to `window.innerWidth - menuWidth - 8` and `window.innerHeight - menuHeight - 8`
  - Prevents menu from extending past the right or bottom edge of the viewport

- **Saved Tab Context Menu Fix**
  - Removed broken "Open in new window" option for saved tabs (no `/saved-standalone` route exists)
  - Saved tab context menu now shows: "Remove tab and unsave concepts" (when 2+ tabs exist) or "No actions available" (when it's the last saved tab)

- Files changed: `AppShell.jsx` (close-tab logic, createDefaultGraphTab, context menu clamping, saved tab context menu)

---

### ✅ Completed (Phase 5d) — Tab Grouping

- **Tab Groups Database Table**
  - New `tab_groups` table: `id`, `user_id`, `name`, `display_order`, `is_expanded`, `created_at`
  - Nullable `group_id` column added to both `saved_tabs` and `graph_tabs` with `ON DELETE SET NULL`
  - Migration adds columns safely with `IF NOT EXISTS` checks — safe to re-run

- **Backend CRUD Endpoints (7 new endpoints)**
  - `GET /votes/tab-groups` — returns user's groups ordered by `display_order`
  - `POST /votes/tab-groups/create` — creates a new named group with auto-incremented `display_order`
  - `POST /votes/tab-groups/rename` — renames a group (validates ownership)
  - `POST /votes/tab-groups/delete` — deletes a group; explicitly sets `group_id = NULL` on all member tabs before deleting the group row
  - `POST /votes/tab-groups/toggle` — persists the expand/collapse state (`is_expanded` boolean)
  - `POST /votes/tab-groups/add-tab` — sets `group_id` on a saved or graph tab (validates both group and tab ownership)
  - `POST /votes/tab-groups/remove-tab` — sets `group_id = NULL` on a saved or graph tab

- **Tab Bar Layout (AppShell.jsx)**
  - Tab bar now shows three zones: ungrouped saved tabs (left) → groups (middle) → ungrouped graph tabs (right)
  - Each group renders as a clickable header with ▸/▾ arrow, group name, and member count badge
  - Clicking the group header expands/collapses it (persisted to DB)
  - When expanded, member tabs appear inline to the right of the group header with a left border visual indicator
  - When collapsed, the group header shows as a single tab; if the active tab is inside a collapsed group, the group header gets active styling
  - Mixed tab types allowed — a group can contain both saved tabs and graph tabs
  - Groups loaded on mount alongside saved tabs and graph tabs via `Promise.all`
  - Expand/collapse uses optimistic state update with revert on failure

- **Context Menu Integration**
  - Right-click any ungrouped tab → "Create group with this tab..." (prompts for name, creates group, adds tab)
  - Right-click any ungrouped tab when groups exist → "Add to group..." (prompts to pick group by number or type new name)
  - Right-click a grouped tab → "Remove from group" (ungroups the tab)
  - Right-click a group header → "Rename group" or "Delete group (keeps tabs)"
  - Double-click a group header to rename inline (same pattern as saved tab renaming)
  - Deleting a group shows a confirmation dialog; member tabs become ungrouped (not deleted)

- Files changed: `migrate.js` (new `tab_groups` table, `group_id` columns on `saved_tabs` and `graph_tabs`), `votesController.js` (7 new endpoints + updated `getGraphTabs`/`getUserTabs` to return `group_id` + updated RETURNING clauses), `votes.js` routes (7 new tab-group routes), `api.js` frontend (7 new tab-group API methods), `AppShell.jsx` (group state, buildTabBarItems layout logic, group rendering, group context menu, group rename, toggle, create/delete handlers)

---

### ✅ Completed (Phase 5e) — Saved Tree Reordering

- **Saved Tree Order Database Table**
  - New `saved_tree_order` table: `id`, `user_id`, `saved_tab_id`, `root_concept_id`, `display_order`, `updated_at`
  - Unique constraint on `(user_id, saved_tab_id, root_concept_id)` — one order entry per tree per tab per user
  - Index on `(user_id, saved_tab_id)` for fast lookups
  - Migration uses `IF NOT EXISTS` — safe to re-run

- **Backend Endpoints (2 new endpoints)**
  - `GET /votes/tree-order?tabId=N` — returns the custom order entries for a specific saved tab
  - `POST /votes/tree-order/update` — accepts `{ tabId, order: [{ rootConceptId, displayOrder }, ...] }` and upserts all entries using `ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE`
  - Both endpoints validate tab ownership before proceeding

- **Frontend: Up/Down Arrow Reordering (SavedTabContent.jsx)**
  - Each root-level tree card now has small ▲/▼ arrow buttons on the left side
  - Top tree's ▲ is disabled; bottom tree's ▼ is disabled
  - Clicking an arrow swaps the tree with its neighbor and persists the full order to the database
  - Uses optimistic state update (instant visual feedback); reverts by reloading from DB on failure
  - Tree order loaded alongside saves on tab switch (`loadTreeOrder` called in `useEffect` alongside `loadSaves`)
  - Trees with explicit order entries appear first (sorted by `display_order` ascending); trees without an entry fall to the bottom sorted by save count descending (original behavior preserved)

- Files changed: `migrate.js` (new `saved_tree_order` table), `votesController.js` (2 new endpoints: `getTreeOrder`, `updateTreeOrder`), `votes.js` routes (2 new tree-order routes), `api.js` frontend (2 new tree-order API methods), `SavedTabContent.jsx` (tree order state, `loadTreeOrder`, `moveTree` handler, ▲/▼ arrow buttons on tree cards)

---

### ✅ Completed (Phase 5f) — Child Ordering Within Vote Sets

- **Child Rankings Database Table**
  - New `child_rankings` table: `id`, `user_id`, `parent_edge_id`, `child_edge_id`, `vote_set_key`, `rank_position`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
  - Unique constraint on `(user_id, parent_edge_id, child_edge_id, vote_set_key)` — one ranking per user per child per vote set
  - Index on `(parent_edge_id, vote_set_key)` for fast aggregation queries
  - Migration uses `IF NOT EXISTS` — safe to re-run

- **Backend Endpoints (3 new endpoints)**
  - `GET /votes/rankings?parentEdgeId=N&voteSetKey=...` — returns the current user's rankings AND aggregated rankings (rank → user count map per child) for a specific vote set
  - `POST /votes/rankings/update` — upserts a ranking. Validates the user has a vote on the parent edge (only your own set can be ranked)
  - `POST /votes/rankings/remove` — deletes a single ranking

- **Vote Set Response Enhancements (conceptsController.js)**
  - `getVoteSets` now returns three additional fields: `userSetIndex` (which set index the current user belongs to, or null), `parentEdgeId` (edge connecting the current concept to its parent — context key for rankings), and `voteSetKey` on each vote set (sorted comma-separated edge IDs for ranking persistence)
  - **Solo vote sets enabled:** Removed `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2` threshold so a single user saving children gets their own color swatch. This is necessary so users can always see and rank their own set.

- **User's Own Swatch Highlight (VoteSetBar.jsx)**
  - The swatch matching the user's vote set gets a bold `2px solid #333` border (visually distinct from the colored outline used for active/selected state)
  - Tooltip changes to "Your vote set · N users saved the same M children"
  - Works in both ungrouped and grouped (super-group) swatch positions

- **Ranking UI on Child Cards (ConceptGrid.jsx)**
  - New ranking section appears below the vote section on each card when exactly 1 swatch is selected
  - **Aggregated rank badges** (always visible when any single set is selected): pills showing "#1: 3", "#2: 1" etc. for each rank position with user counts
  - **Dropdown selector** (only when viewing your own vote set): "Rank: [—|1|2|3|...|N]" where N = number of children in the set. Selecting "—" removes the ranking.
  - Styling uses EB Garamond font, muted colors, subtle off-white background consistent with Zen aesthetic

- **Rank-Based Sorting (Concept.jsx)**
  - When rankings exist for the selected single set, children are sorted by most popular rank: rank with highest user count wins, then by user count for that rank, then by save count. Unranked children fall to the bottom.
  - Rankings loaded via `useEffect` whenever exactly 1 individual swatch is selected (no groups)
  - Filter info bar shows contextual hints: "· rank your children with the dropdown" (own set) or "· sorted by community ranking" (other set)

- **Ranking Cleanup on Unsave**
  - `removeVote`: after deleting votes on unsaved edges, deletes any `child_rankings` rows where `child_edge_id` is among the removed edges
  - `removeVoteFromTab`: when a vote is fully deleted (last tab link removed), deletes any `child_rankings` for that edge
  - This ensures stale rankings don't accumulate when users change their saves

- Files changed: `migrate.js` (new `child_rankings` table), `conceptsController.js` (`getVoteSets` response enhancements: `userSetIndex`, `parentEdgeId`, `voteSetKey`; removed 2+ user threshold), `votesController.js` (3 new ranking endpoints + ranking cleanup on unsave in `removeVote` and `removeVoteFromTab`), `votes.js` routes (3 new ranking routes), `api.js` frontend (3 new ranking API methods), `VoteSetBar.jsx` (user swatch highlight with bold border + tooltip), `ConceptGrid.jsx` (ranking section with dropdown + aggregated badges), `Concept.jsx` (ranking state, loading, rank-based sorting, filter hints)

## Pending Features

### Phase 5: Saved Page

- **Saved Page (formerly Voted Page)**
  - Per-user page showing all concepts the user has saved
  - **Stability:** The Saved page itself is stable — it only changes when the user explicitly saves or unsaves. There is no UI churn from graph evolution.
  - **Dynamic child sets:** The child sets of the user's saved leaf nodes evolve as other users add content, but the user's own list of bookmarks does not change.
  - Swap votes visually distinct from regular saves
  - Swap votes include links to destination concepts
  - Link votes (Flip View) also appear here
  - All vote types are assertions the user continuously maintains and alters as their experiences change

- **Unsave Cascading (from Saved Page)**
  - Each concept on the Saved page has a small **X button** to remove it and all its descendants
  - The X button functions identically to unsaving in the children view (which is already implemented)

- **Saved Page Tabs** — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 5b)
  - See "Completed (Phase 5b)" section above for full details

- **In-App Tabs for Navigation (Concept Panes)** — ✅ COMPLETE (Phase 5c)
  - ✅ Unified tab bar with saved tabs + graph tabs in AppShell
  - ✅ `graph_tabs` database table with persistent navigation state
  - ✅ Backend CRUD for graph tabs, right-click context menus, close/duplicate
  - ✅ SavedTabContent.jsx renders inside saved tabs, clicking concepts opens graph tabs
  - ✅ Within-tab navigation with back button, breadcrumb clicks, flip view toggle
  - ✅ Search results navigate within current graph tab
  - ✅ Adjacent-tab switching on close, auto-create on last close, context menu polish
  - Users can have **multiple open concept pane tabs** within the Orca app UI (like browser-style tabs at the top of the app, not actual browser tabs)
  - Each tab maintains its own navigation state — users can explore different areas of different graphs without losing their place
  - The same graph can be open on multiple tabs simultaneously
  - **Duplicate Tab:** Users can duplicate an open tab, creating a new tab at the same position in the same graph — useful for branching off in different navigational directions
  - Saved page tabs also appear as in-app tabs alongside concept pane tabs (Note: this will change in Phase 7c — saved tabs will leave the main tab bar and be replaced by persistent corpus tabs; saves will move to a standalone Saved Page)
  - **Right-click any tab** (Saved tab or concept pane tab) to open it in a new browser tab/window

- **Tab Grouping** — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 5d)
  - Users can group any combination of tabs (corpus tabs and graph/concept pane tabs) into named tab groups
  - A tab group appears as a single tab in the tab bar; clicking it expands to reveal its component tabs, which the user can then click into
  - **Flat grouping only:** Groups cannot contain other groups (one level of nesting). This keeps the UI simple and avoids deep hierarchies
  - **Mixed types allowed:** A single group can contain tabs of different types (e.g., a corpus tab and two graph pane tabs grouped together under "Work Projects")
  - Users can name groups at creation time and rename them later (double-click or right-click → Rename group)
  - Tabs can be added to/removed from groups via right-click context menu
  - Group membership, ordering, and expand/collapse state persisted server-side for cross-session stability
  - **Database:** `tab_groups` table + `group_id` foreign key on `graph_tabs` (and future `corpus_tabs` table when Phase 7 is built)
  - **Note:** Saved tabs are no longer in the main tab bar (see Phase 7c "Saved Page Overhaul"). The `saved_tabs.group_id` column from the original Phase 5d implementation will be retired when Phase 7c is built.

- **Saved Tree Reordering** — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 5e)
  - Within a saved tab, users can reorder the root-level graph trees using up/down arrow buttons
  - Order persists between sessions via `saved_tree_order` database table
  - Trees without an explicit order record fall to the bottom, sorted by save count as before
  - Each saved tab has its own independent ordering

- **Child Ordering Within Vote Sets** — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 5f)
  - When filtering to a **single** identical vote set, users can assign a numeric order (1, 2, 3…) via dropdown selector
  - Users can only rank children within their own vote set; other sets show aggregated rankings read-only
  - Your own identical vote set swatch has a bold dark border and "Your vote set" tooltip
  - Rankings are stored in the `child_rankings` table, keyed by a deterministic `vote_set_key` (sorted comma-separated edge IDs)
  - **Aggregated display:** For each child, pills show the count of users who assigned each rank number. Sort children by the most popular rank (the rank with the highest count wins)
  - **Solo sets supported:** A user with a unique save pattern gets their own swatch and can rank their children even before anyone else shares their exact set
  - Ranking cleanup on unsave prevents stale data accumulation
  - See "Completed (Phase 5f)" section above for full implementation details

- **Ctrl+F Functionality (Phase 5 — Verification)** — ✅ VERIFIED
  - Browser-native Ctrl+F works on all pages: Root, Concept (children view), Flip View, Saved tabs
  - No custom in-app search needed — rendered text is findable by the browser's built-in find

- **Read-Only Guest Access (Pre-Login)** — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 5 misc)
  - Users who are not logged in can search and navigate around graphs with read-only access
  - They can see save counts, vote information, vote set swatches/dots, and all public concept/edge data
  - They can open graph tabs in the tab bar for temporary exploration — these are ephemeral (local state only, not persisted to DB)
  - No saved tabs, no save/vote functionality, no tab persistence, no tab groups
  - Login/signup buttons visible in the header as the primary call-to-action
  - Backend uses `optionalAuth` middleware on concept GET routes; `req.user = null` for guests
  - Frontend passes `isGuest` prop through AppShell → Root/Concept/ConceptGrid/FlipView/SearchField
  - Vote buttons show read-only counts (grayed out, "Log in to save concepts" tooltip); link vote button hidden for guests
  - "Add as child" and "Create as root" hidden from SearchField for guests

- **Search Results Surfacing Saved Tabs and Corpus Annotations** — ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED (Phase 5 misc + Post-Phase 7 cleanup)
  - When a logged-in user searches, results that appear in their saved tabs or subscribed corpuses (via annotations) are shown at the top with an "In your saves / corpuses" section header
  - Each saved-tab result shows a green italic badge with the tab name(s) (e.g., "Research, Work")
  - Each corpus-annotation result shows a 📚 blue-tinted badge with corpus name(s)
  - Both badges can appear on the same result if a concept is both saved and annotated
  - Backend cross-references search results against `votes` → `vote_tab_links` → `saved_tabs` → `edges` for saved tabs, and `document_annotations` → `edges` → `corpuses` → `corpus_subscriptions` for corpus annotations
  - Results with any context (saved tabs or corpus annotations) sort to the top
  - Backend also returns `exactMatch` boolean

### ✅ Completed (Phase 6) — External Links

- **External Links Page (Phase 6a + 6b)**
  - New `concept_links` and `concept_link_votes` database tables
  - Users can attach external URLs to a concept in a specific parent path context
  - 🔗 **Links** button in the concept header bar (next to Flip View toggle) opens the External Links page
  - Links button only appears when `parentEdgeId` is available (after vote sets load)
  - Each link shows: upvote button + count, clickable title/URL (opens in new tab), domain, who added it and when
  - Sort toggle: by votes (default) or by newest
  - "Add external link" form for logged-in users (URL + optional title input)
  - URL validation: must start with `http://` or `https://`, max 2048 characters
  - Duplicate URL detection per edge (409 Conflict if same URL already added)
  - Auto-upvote: the user who adds a link automatically upvotes it
  - Only the user who added a link can remove it (server-side validation)
  - Guests see everything read-only (no add form, no upvote buttons)
  - View mode stored as `'links'` in tab navigation state with proper back button support
  - SearchField hidden in links view (same as flip view)
  - Backend endpoints: `GET /votes/web-links/:edgeId` (optionalAuth), `POST /votes/web-links/add`, `POST /votes/web-links/remove`, `POST /votes/web-links/upvote`, `POST /votes/web-links/unvote`
  - New `WebLinksView.jsx` component

- **Cross-Context Links Compilation (Phase 6c)**
  - 🔗 **All Links** button in the Flip View header opens a cross-context links view
  - New backend endpoint `GET /votes/web-links/all/:conceptId?path=...` fetches all web links across ALL parent contexts for a concept
  - Links grouped by parent context (edge), with parent name, full path, attribute displayed
  - Current context highlighted at top with bold border and "current" badge
  - Groups sorted: current context first, then by total link votes descending
  - Collapsible groups — auto-expanded for groups with links and the current context
  - Upvoting only interactive for links in the current context; other contexts show "view only"
  - View mode stored as `'fliplinks'` with proper nav history (back returns to Flip View)
  - New `FlipLinksView.jsx` component
  - `FlipView.jsx` updated with new `onOpenFlipLinks` callback prop

- **Shareable Concept Links (Phase 6d)**
  - 📋 **Share** button in the concept header bar (right side, next to other buttons)
  - Clicking copies a full URL like `http://localhost:3000/concept/5?path=1,2` to clipboard
  - Button text briefly changes to "✓ Copied!" for 2 seconds, then reverts
  - Uses `navigator.clipboard.writeText` with fallback for older browsers
  - Available in all view modes (children, flip, links) — hidden only in decontextualized flip view

- Files changed: `migrate.js` (2 new tables: `concept_links`, `concept_link_votes`), `votesController.js` (6 new endpoints: getWebLinks, addWebLink, removeWebLink, upvoteWebLink, removeWebLinkVote, getAllWebLinksForConcept), `votes.js` routes (6 new web-link routes with optionalAuth for GETs), `api.js` frontend (6 new web-link API methods), new `WebLinksView.jsx`, new `FlipLinksView.jsx`, `FlipView.jsx` (🔗 All Links button + onOpenFlipLinks prop), `Concept.jsx` (🔗 Links button, 📋 Share button, 'links'/'fliplinks' view modes, handleToggleLinksView, handleOpenFlipLinks, handleShareLink)

### Phase 7: Corpuses, Documents, Annotations & Color Sets

A major new surface for Orca. **Corpuses** are the primary organizational unit for documents. Users upload documents and place them into corpuses. Annotations, permissions, and subscriptions all operate at the corpus level. This phase is broken into sub-phases.

### ✅ Completed (Phase 7a) — Corpus & Document Infrastructure

- **Database Tables**
  - New `corpuses` table: name, optional description, annotation_mode (public/private), created_by
  - New `documents` table: title, immutable body text, format (plain/markdown), uploaded_by
  - New `corpus_documents` junction table with `UNIQUE(corpus_id, document_id)` and cascading deletes
  - All tables use `IF NOT EXISTS` — migration safe to re-run

- **Backend: Corpus CRUD (6 endpoints in `corpusController.js`)**
  - `GET /api/corpuses/` — list all corpuses with owner username and document counts (guest OK)
  - `GET /api/corpuses/mine` — list current user's own corpuses (auth required)
  - `GET /api/corpuses/:id` — get corpus details + document list (guest OK)
  - `POST /api/corpuses/create` — create a new corpus (auth required)
  - `POST /api/corpuses/:id/update` — update name/description/mode (owner only)
  - `POST /api/corpuses/:id/delete` — delete corpus with orphan document cleanup (owner only, transactional)

- **Backend: Document Endpoints (4 endpoints)**
  - `POST /api/corpuses/:id/documents/upload` — upload new document into a corpus (creates document + links in transaction)
  - `POST /api/corpuses/:id/documents/add` — add existing document to corpus (owner only)
  - `POST /api/corpuses/:id/documents/remove` — remove document from corpus with orphan cleanup (owner only, transactional)
  - `GET /api/documents/:id` — get document with full body text + list of corpuses (standalone route, guest OK)

- **Frontend: API Service Layer**
  - New `corpusAPI` export in `api.js`: listAll, listMine, getCorpus, create, update, deleteCorpus, uploadDocument, addDocument, removeDocument
  - New `documentsAPI` export in `api.js`: getDocument

- **Frontend: Corpus Browsing UI**
  - 📚 **Corpuses** button added to AppShell header (visible to both guests and logged-in users)
  - `CorpusListView.jsx` — browse all corpuses or filter to "My Corpuses", create new corpus with name/description/annotation mode
  - `CorpusDetailView.jsx` — view corpus details, document list, upload documents (text input), edit/delete corpus (owner only), remove documents from corpus
  - `DocumentView.jsx` — full document text reader with corpus membership links, back navigation
  - Corpus views render as an overlay in AppShell's content area (replaces tab content when active, tab content preserved underneath)
  - Navigation: Corpuses button → Corpus List → Corpus Detail → Document View, with ← back buttons throughout

- **Route Ordering Fix**
  - Express routes in `corpuses.js` ordered with specific paths (`/mine`, `/create`) before parameterized `/:id` to prevent route conflicts
  - Auth middleware import matches the existing export pattern (`const authenticateToken = require(...)` + `const optionalAuth = authenticateToken.optionalAuth`)

- Files changed: `migrate.js` (3 new tables), new `corpusController.js` (10 endpoints), new `routes/corpuses.js`, `server.js` (new route mount + standalone document route), `api.js` frontend (2 new API exports), `AppShell.jsx` (📚 button, corpus view state, corpus view rendering), new `CorpusListView.jsx`, new `CorpusDetailView.jsx`, new `DocumentView.jsx`

#### Core Concept: Corpuses

- **A corpus is a named collection of documents**, created and owned by a single user
- Every document must belong to at least one corpus — there are no "unattached" documents
- The same document can appear in multiple corpuses (added by different corpus owners)
- **Annotations are scoped to the corpus**, not the document globally — the same document in two different corpuses has entirely separate annotations
- **Every corpus has both a public and editorial annotation layer** (Phase 7g, renamed Phase 10a) — the public layer is open to any logged-in user; the editorial layer is maintained by allowed users invited by the corpus owner. All annotations (both layers) are visible to everyone; only creation/voting on editorial annotations is restricted to allowed users.
- **Subscriptions are per-corpus**, not per-document
- Any user can create a corpus
- Corpus owners can add and remove documents from their corpus, even documents they didn't upload
- **Allowed users** (invited by owner) can also add documents and create document versions within the corpus
- **Document lifecycle:** A document is only deleted from the system if it's not in any corpus. Deleting a corpus removes its documents only if those documents aren't in any other corpus — except documents uploaded by allowed users, which are left orphaned for rescue (Phase 9b). Documents cannot be manually deleted by anyone (except via the orphan dismiss flow) — their existence is governed entirely by corpus membership.
- **Document immutability:** Documents are immutable once finalized. New document versions (Phase 7h) start in an editable draft state; once finalized, text and annotation offsets are locked.

#### Phase 7a: Corpus & Document Upload

- **Corpus Creation**
  - Any user can create a named corpus at any time
  - Creating a corpus is a prerequisite for uploading a document (you must place it somewhere)

- **Document Upload**
  - Users upload documents to Orca (plain text or Markdown to start — no PDF/DOCX parsing in v1)
  - On upload, the user selects which corpus to place the document in (even if the corpus has no other documents yet)
  - Documents are stored server-side with metadata (title, uploader, format, created_at)
  - Each document has a unique URL within Orca
  - All documents are publicly visible to any Orca user (the public/private distinction applies to annotations, not document content)

- **Corpus Document Management**
  - Corpus owners can add existing documents to their corpus (even if uploaded by someone else)
  - Corpus owners can remove documents from their corpus
  - Removing a document from a corpus deletes all annotations for that document within that corpus
  - If removing the document leaves it in zero corpuses, the document itself is deleted

- **Database:** New `corpuses` table:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE corpuses (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    annotation_mode VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'public', -- 'public' or 'private'
    created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  );
  ```
  New `documents` table:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE documents (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    body TEXT NOT NULL,
    format VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'plain', -- 'plain' or 'markdown'
    uploaded_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  );
  ```
  New `corpus_documents` junction table:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE corpus_documents (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    corpus_id INTEGER REFERENCES corpuses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    document_id INTEGER REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    added_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(corpus_id, document_id)
  );
  ```

### ✅ Completed (Phase 7b) — Duplicate Detection on Upload

- **Similarity Check Before Committing**
  - When a user clicks "Upload" in the corpus detail view, the system first checks existing documents for text similarity before committing the upload
  - Uses PostgreSQL's `pg_trgm` `similarity()` function on a truncated prefix (first 5,000 characters) of the document body for performance
  - Threshold: 0.3 (30% trigram similarity) — catches near-duplicates and substantially similar content without too many false positives
  - Returns up to 10 matches, sorted by similarity score descending
  - Each match includes: document title, uploader username, upload date, similarity percentage, and list of corpuses the document belongs to
  - **Two-step upload flow:** User fills in title/body/format → clicks Upload → system checks for duplicates → if matches found, a warm-toned panel appears showing the matches → user can "Upload anyway" or "Cancel"
  - If no matches found (or if the duplicate check endpoint fails gracefully), the upload proceeds immediately without showing the panel
  - **Graceful degradation:** If the `pg_trgm` similarity query fails (e.g., extension not available), the upload proceeds normally — the duplicate check is a best-effort pre-upload confirmation, not a hard gate
  - New trigram GIN index on `documents.body` (`idx_documents_body_trgm`) for fast similarity matching
  - New backend endpoint: `POST /api/corpuses/check-duplicates` (auth required)
  - New frontend API method: `corpusAPI.checkDuplicates(body)`

- **Unique Name Validation**
  - **Corpus names** are now unique (case-insensitive). Creating or renaming a corpus to an existing name returns 409 Conflict.
  - **Document titles** are now unique (case-insensitive). Uploading a document with an existing title returns 409 Conflict.
  - Corpus and document namespaces are independent — a corpus and document can share the same name.

- **Bug Fix: Stray Brace in Concept.jsx**
  - Fixed extra `}` on line 889 of `Concept.jsx` that caused a Vite warning: `The character "}" is not valid inside a JSX element`
  - Was a harmless warning (app still ran) but cleaned up for correctness

- Files changed: `migrate.js` (new `idx_documents_body_trgm` GIN index), `corpusController.js` (new `checkDuplicates` endpoint + unique name validation on corpus create/update + unique title validation on document upload), `corpuses.js` routes (new `POST /check-duplicates` route), `api.js` frontend (new `checkDuplicates` API method), `CorpusDetailView.jsx` (two-step upload flow with duplicate matches UI), `Concept.jsx` (stray brace fix)

#### Phase 7b: Duplicate Detection on Upload — ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ **Similarity Check Before Committing**
  - As a user uploads a document, they are shown any existing documents that meet a high similarity percentage
  - Prevents unnecessary duplicate uploads — user can subscribe to a corpus containing the existing document instead
  - Uses text similarity metric (pg_trgm `similarity()` on first 5000 chars) against existing document bodies
  - Shown as a pre-upload confirmation step: "These existing documents are very similar — do you want to find a corpus with one instead?"
  - If no matches or user proceeds anyway, upload completes normally

### ✅ Completed (Phase 7c) — Corpus Subscriptions, Corpus Tabs & Saved Page Overhaul

- **Corpus Subscriptions Backend (7c-1)**
  - New `corpus_subscriptions` table with `UNIQUE(user_id, corpus_id)` and indexes on both columns
  - Three new backend endpoints: `POST /subscribe`, `POST /unsubscribe`, `GET /subscriptions`
  - `listCorpuses` now returns `subscriber_count` and `user_subscribed` per corpus
  - `getCorpus` now returns `subscriber_count` and `userSubscribed`
  - Three new frontend API methods on `corpusAPI`: `subscribe()`, `unsubscribe()`, `getMySubscriptions()`

- **Corpus Tabs in Main Tab Bar (7c-2)**
  - Subscribing to a corpus creates a persistent **📚 corpus tab** in the main tab bar
  - Corpus tabs appear alongside graph tabs — the tab bar now contains only corpus tabs and graph tabs
  - New `CorpusTabContent.jsx` component renders inside corpus tabs: corpus info, document list, upload form (with duplicate detection), and an inline document viewer with back navigation
  - `CorpusListView.jsx` updated with subscriber count and "Subscribe" button (or "subscribed" badge) on each corpus card
  - `CorpusDetailView.jsx` updated with subscriber count and Subscribe/Unsubscribe buttons
  - `AppShell.jsx` loads subscriptions on mount via `corpusAPI.getMySubscriptions()`, manages corpus tab state, handles subscribe/unsubscribe callbacks
  - Active tab type now supports `'corpus'` alongside `'graph'`
  - Unsubscribing removes the corpus tab and switches to the next available tab

- **Saved Page Overhaul (7c-3)**
  - **Saved tabs removed from the main tab bar entirely** — they no longer appear alongside corpus/graph tabs
  - New **"Saved"** button in the header (visible to logged-in users) opens a standalone Saved Page overlay
  - New `SavedPageOverlay.jsx` component contains the full saved tabs system internally: tab bar, create/rename/delete tabs, SavedTabContent rendering
  - Clicking a concept in a saved tree opens it in a new graph tab AND closes the overlay
  - The existing `saved_tabs` and `vote_tab_links` tables remain in the database — they're still used inside the Saved Page. They will be retired when Phase 7d annotations enable corpus-based organization on the Saved Page.

- **Cleanup (7c-4)**
  - Removed dead saved-tab UI state from AppShell (showNewSavedTabInput, newSavedTabName, renamingSavedTabId, renameValue, refs)
  - Removed saved tab CRUD handlers from AppShell (now in SavedPageOverlay)
  - Removed saved tab context menu rendering from main tab bar
  - Removed `type: 'saved'` from active tab fallback logic — saved tabs can no longer be active in the main tab bar
  - Simplified `renderTabButton` to graph-tabs-only (no more saved tab renaming or italic styling in main tab bar)
  - Simplified `groupContainsActiveTab` to check graph tabs only
  - Removed dead styles: `savedTabButton`, `newSavedTabButton`, `newTabInputField`, `renameInput`

- Files changed (across all 7c sub-phases): `migrate.js` (new `corpus_subscriptions` table), `corpusController.js` (3 new subscription endpoints + updated `listCorpuses`/`getCorpus` with subscriber data), `corpuses.js` routes (3 new subscription routes), `api.js` frontend (3 new subscription API methods), `AppShell.jsx` (corpus tabs, saved page button, cleanup), new `CorpusTabContent.jsx`, new `SavedPageOverlay.jsx`, `CorpusListView.jsx` (subscriber count + subscribe button), `CorpusDetailView.jsx` (subscriber count + subscribe/unsubscribe buttons)

### ✅ Completed (Phase 7d-1 + 7d-2) — Annotation Infrastructure & Annotation Creation UI

- **Database: `document_annotations` Table (7d-1)**
  - New table with `corpus_id`, `document_id`, `edge_id`, `start_position`, `end_position`, `created_by`
  - `CHECK` constraint ensures `start_position >= 0` and `end_position > start_position`
  - Three indexes: `(corpus_id, document_id)` for document view queries, `edge_id` for bidirectional linking, `document_id` for cross-corpus queries
  - `ON DELETE CASCADE` from all three FKs (corpus, document, edge)

- **Backend: 4 New Annotation Endpoints (7d-1)**
  - `POST /api/corpuses/annotations/create` — create annotation. Validates: corpus exists, annotation permission (public vs private mode), document is in corpus, edge exists, end position doesn't exceed document length
  - `GET /api/corpuses/:corpusId/documents/:documentId/annotations` — get all annotations for a document in a corpus, with edge details (concept name, attribute, parent name, graph_path), sorted by position. Guest-accessible.
  - `POST /api/corpuses/annotations/delete` — delete annotation. Public corpus: only creator can delete. Private corpus: creator or corpus owner can delete.
  - `GET /api/corpuses/annotations/edge/:edgeId` — get all annotations for an edge across all corpuses, grouped by corpus → document, with text snippets and subscriber counts. Guest-accessible. (For External Links page, Phase 7d-3/4.)
  - Route ordering: annotation-specific routes (`/annotations/create`, `/annotations/delete`, `/annotations/edge/:edgeId`) placed BEFORE `/:id` parameterized routes to avoid Express treating "annotations" as an `:id`

- **Frontend: Annotation Creation UI (7d-2)**
  - New `AnnotationPanel.jsx` component — floating panel for the annotation creation flow
  - **Two-step flow:** (1) search for a concept with 300ms debounced `searchConcepts` API, (2) pick a parent context (edge) with full resolved path display
  - Search input pre-fills with the selected text (first 40 characters)
  - **Root concept support:** Also checks `getRootConcepts` endpoint for root edges (the parents endpoint excludes them because it JOINs on `parent_id` which is NULL for roots). Root contexts appear with a "root" badge.
  - **Full path resolution:** Uses `getConceptNames` batch endpoint to resolve `graph_path` integer arrays to concept names. Displays the complete ancestor chain (e.g., *Health → Fitness →* **Exercise [action]**) not just the immediate parent.
  - Panel appears fixed at bottom-center of the viewport when user clicks "📌 Annotate"

- **Frontend: Annotation Display & Highlights (7d-2)**
  - `CorpusTabContent.jsx` document viewer updated with annotation awareness
  - **Highlight rendering:** Annotations appear as highlighted text regions (warm amber underline, `rgba(232, 217, 160, 0.35)` background) — consistent with Orca's no-color-except-vote-sets philosophy
  - **Non-overlapping segments:** Frontend builds segments from sorted annotations; overlapping annotations take first-wins approach
  - **Click to inspect:** Clicking a highlighted annotation opens a right-side detail panel showing the full resolved path (ancestors in italic gray → leaf concept in bold), creator username, date, and "Remove annotation" button
  - **Full path in sidebar:** Path names resolved via `getConceptNames` batch endpoint on annotation load (same approach as AnnotationPanel)
  - Annotations reload automatically after creation or deletion
  - Guests see highlights but cannot create annotations (toolbar hidden for guests)

- **Text Selection Flow**
  - User selects text in the document body → floating "📌 Annotate" toolbar appears at bottom-center
  - Toolbar has Annotate button + ✕ dismiss button
  - Character offset calculation uses DOM Range API (`window.document.createRange()`) to compute exact positions within the document body text node
  - Selection state cleared on annotation creation, panel close, or explicit dismiss

- **Bug Fix: `document` Variable Shadowing**
  - React state variable named `document` (the Orca document object) shadowed the browser's global `document` (DOM). Calling `document.createRange()` failed with "Cannot read properties of null" because it was calling `.createRange()` on the Orca document state (which could be null), not the browser DOM.
  - Fix: use `window.document.createRange()` to explicitly reach the browser API
  - **Learning:** Avoid naming React state variables `document` in components that need DOM APIs

- **Known Limitation: Corpus Tab State Not Persisted on Refresh**
  - Refreshing the browser while viewing a document inside a corpus tab returns the user to a graph tab. Corpus tab sub-view state (which document is open) is only in React state, not persisted to the database. The active tab selection also isn't persisted. This is consistent with how corpus tabs have worked since Phase 7c — a future polish pass could add persistence similar to `graph_tabs`.

- Files changed: `migrate.js` (new `document_annotations` table with indexes + CHECK constraint), `corpusController.js` (4 new annotation endpoints: createAnnotation, getDocumentAnnotations, deleteAnnotation, getAnnotationsForEdge), `corpuses.js` routes (4 new annotation routes with correct ordering before `/:id`), `api.js` frontend (4 new annotation API methods on `corpusAPI`), `CorpusTabContent.jsx` (annotation loading with path name resolution, text selection handler with DOM Range offset calculation, annotation highlights, detail sidebar with full path, AnnotationPanel integration), new `AnnotationPanel.jsx` (two-step annotation creation: concept search + context picker with root edge support and full path display)

### ✅ Completed (Phase 7d-3 + 7d-4) — Annotation Display Polish & Bidirectional Linking

- **Annotation Detail: Navigate to Concept (7d-3)**
  - Annotation detail sidebar in `CorpusTabContent` now has a **"Navigate to concept →"** button
  - Clicking it opens the annotated concept in a new graph tab using the annotation's edge data (`child_id` as concept ID, `graph_path` for path context)
  - Uses `onOpenConceptTab` callback threaded from AppShell → CorpusTabContent
  - Guests don't see the button (no graph tab creation for guests from this context)

- **Document Annotations Section on External Links Page (7d-4)**
  - `WebLinksView.jsx` now has two sections: **Web Links** (Phase 6, unchanged) and **Document Annotations** (new)
  - Document Annotations section calls `corpusAPI.getAnnotationsForEdge(edgeId)` — the endpoint built in 7d-1
  - **Corpus-grouped display:** Annotations are grouped by corpus, each corpus is a collapsible group (▸/▾ toggle)
  - Each corpus group shows: 📚 icon, corpus name (clickable — subscribes and opens corpus tab), annotation count, subscriber count
  - Each document within a corpus shows: document title (clickable — opens the specific document in the corpus tab), annotation count
  - Each annotation shows: quoted text snippet (up to 200 chars, with amber left-border consistent with annotation highlight styling), creator username, date
  - **Two sort modes:** ↓ Newest (corpuses ordered by most recent annotation, documents within each corpus also by recency) and ↓ Subscribers (corpuses ordered by subscriber count)
  - Sort buttons use the same active/inactive toggle styling as the rest of the app (dark background when active)
  - All corpuses auto-expanded on load

- **Pending Document Navigation (7d-4 infrastructure)**
  - New `pendingCorpusDocumentId` state in AppShell — stores a document ID to auto-open after switching to a corpus tab
  - `handleSubscribeToCorpus` now accepts optional third parameter `documentId`
  - `CorpusTabContent` accepts `pendingDocumentId` prop; a `useEffect` auto-calls `handleOpenDocument` once the corpus finishes loading
  - `onPendingDocumentConsumed` callback clears the pending state after consumption
  - Used by both External Links page (clicking a document title) and Corpuses overlay (clicking a document in `CorpusDetailView`)

- **Corpus Overlay Document Opens Redirected to Corpus Tab (7d-4 bug fix)**
  - Previously, clicking a document in `CorpusDetailView` (Corpuses overlay) opened the Phase 7a `DocumentView` component which had no annotation support
  - Now redirects to the corpus tab: subscribes (or switches), passes `pendingDocumentId`, closes the overlay
  - `CorpusDetailView.jsx` updated to pass `corpus.name` as second argument in `onOpenDocument(docId, corpusName)` for proper tab labeling
  - All document viewing now goes through `CorpusTabContent`, ensuring consistent annotation support

- **Annotation Loading Race Condition Fix (7d-4 bug fix)**
  - `handleOpenDocument` in CorpusTabContent now `await`s `loadAnnotations(docId)` before setting `docLoading = false`
  - Ensures annotations are fully loaded before the document renders, preventing the empty-annotations-on-first-visit issue

- **Prop Threading (7d-3 + 7d-4)**
  - `AppShell.jsx` → `Concept.jsx`: new props `onOpenCorpusTab` (for subscribing/switching to corpus tabs from External Links) and `onOpenConceptTab` (for opening concepts from annotation detail)
  - `AppShell.jsx` → `CorpusTabContent.jsx`: new props `onOpenConceptTab`, `pendingDocumentId`, `onPendingDocumentConsumed`
  - `Concept.jsx` → `WebLinksView.jsx`: passes through `onOpenCorpusTab` and `onOpenConceptTab`

- Files changed: `AppShell.jsx` (new `pendingCorpusDocumentId` state, updated `handleSubscribeToCorpus` with optional `documentId`, new props on CorpusTabContent and Concept, corpus overlay document click redirected to corpus tab), `Concept.jsx` (accepts and passes through `onOpenCorpusTab`/`onOpenConceptTab` to WebLinksView), `WebLinksView.jsx` (imports `corpusAPI`, new Document Annotations section with corpus-grouped collapsible display, sort modes, annotation snippets), `CorpusTabContent.jsx` (accepts `onOpenConceptTab`/`pendingDocumentId`/`onPendingDocumentConsumed`, "Navigate to concept →" button in annotation sidebar, `pendingDocumentId` auto-open effect, `await loadAnnotations` fix), `CorpusDetailView.jsx` (passes `corpus.name` in `onOpenDocument` callback)

#### Phase 7c: Corpus UI & Document Viewing

- **Corpus Tabs Are Persistent (Subscription = Tab)**
  - Subscribing to a corpus adds it as a persistent tab in the main tab bar (alongside graph tabs)
  - Unsubscribing from a corpus removes it from the tab bar
  - Corpus tabs replace saved tabs as the persistent elements in the tab bar — saved tabs no longer appear in the main tab bar (see "Saved Page Overhaul" in Phase 7c notes below)
  - The tab bar now contains only two types: **corpus tabs** (persistent, subscription-based) and **graph tabs** (persistent, user-created)
  - Corpus tabs can be placed into tab groups (Phase 5d)
  - Corpus tabs are NOT closeable with ✕ — unsubscribing is the way to remove them (closing the tab would be confusing since it implies unsubscribing)
  - When you open a corpus tab, you see a list of documents in that corpus with search functionality
  - Selecting a document opens it on screen in **contextualized view** — this is where you see annotations scoped to that corpus

- **Document View — Contextualized (Inside Corpus Tab)**
  - Annotations are highlighted portions of the document text, scoped to the corpus you're viewing
  - Clicking an annotation reveals it in a right-side panel (like Google Docs comments)
  - The right panel shows: the full path from root to the leaf concept selected as the annotation, the number of votes the annotation has, and the color sets voted for by the author or other users
  - **Color set on annotations:** The color set represents the vote set of the leaf concept's children that users who vote for that color set on the annotation prefer — same color set / vote set system used elsewhere in Orca
  - Users can **favorite** documents within a corpus — favorited docs appear at the top of the document list for that user in that corpus (per-corpus favoriting, not global)
  - No "view in other corpuses" button needed in contextualized view — the document belongs to the corpus you have open

- **Document View — Decontextualized**
  - For any document, users can open a decontextualized view that shows ALL annotations from ALL corpuses the document belongs to
  - Annotations display one at a time — clicking a highlighted text region shows that annotation's details in the right-side panel
  - The right panel shows: the full path from root to the leaf concept, vote count, and color sets (same as contextualized view)
  - **Cross-corpus annotation attribution:** Each annotation in decontextualized view shows which corpus (or corpuses) it belongs to. If the same text range is annotated with the same edge in multiple corpuses, ALL those corpuses are listed
  - **Jump to corpus:** Each listed corpus is clickable — clicking opens that corpus as a new corpus tab in the main tab bar (subscribing the user if not already subscribed, or just switching to the existing tab if already subscribed)
  - Decontextualized view is **read-only** — no voting, no adding annotations

- **View in Other Corpuses (from contextualized view)**
  - From the contextualized document view, users can click "View in other corpuses" to see all corpuses containing this document
  - Corpuses listed by title and subscriber count
  - Clicking a corpus opens the document within that corpus as a new corpus tab (showing that corpus's annotations)
  - Some corpuses may have private-layer annotations — non-allowed users will only see the public layer's annotations for those corpuses

- **Saved Page Overhaul (Replaces Saved Tabs in Tab Bar)**
  - Saved tabs are removed from the main tab bar entirely
  - A single **Saved Page** is accessible via a button from the Root page or Concept pages (a separate page with a back button to return to docs/graph)
  - Within the Saved Page, saves are organized into tabs based on **corpus association:**
    1. **One tab per subscribed corpus** — a tree appears in a corpus tab if any concept in the tree exists as an annotation in that corpus. "Exists as an annotation" means the concept (or any concept further down the same path as the annotation) has been saved by the user. Saves that are ancestors of an annotation but not at or below the annotation level go in the uncategorized tab instead.
    2. **One tab for "unsubscribed" corpuses** — if the user unsubscribes from a corpus but still has saves associated with it, that corpus tab remains on the Saved Page marked "Unsubscribed." If all associated saves are removed, the unsubscribed tab disappears automatically.
    3. **One "Uncategorized" tab** — saves that don't appear in any corpus (or are only ancestors above annotation level) go here.
  - The same tree can appear in multiple corpus tabs (if the annotation concept exists in multiple corpuses). Unsaving removes it from all relevant tabs.
  - **No tab picker on save** — when saving a concept, it just saves. The tree automatically appears in the appropriate corpus tabs based on annotation membership.
  - **Tree reordering** is supported in all tabs on the Saved Page (same up/down arrow UI as before)
  - The existing `saved_tree_order` table continues to work, keyed per Saved Page tab
  - **Database implications:** The `saved_tabs` and `vote_tab_links` tables from Phase 5b are retired. Saved Page corpus tabs are dynamically generated views based on `corpus_subscriptions` + `document_annotations` + `votes`/`edges` relationships. The `subscription_tab_links` table from Phase 9a is no longer needed. The `saved_tree_order` table needs a new keying mechanism (corpus_id instead of saved_tab_id, plus a special key for the uncategorized tab).

#### Phase 7d: Annotation Creation & Edge Linking

- **Text Selection → Edge Annotation**
  - Users select a portion of text (or the whole document) and attach an edge as an annotation
  - Annotations store character offsets (start_position, end_position) against the immutable document body
  - **Annotations are scoped to the corpus** — the same document in different corpuses has entirely separate annotation sets
  - The attached edge represents a concept-in-context (specific path + attribute), linking the annotation into the graph
  - Clicking any annotation navigates to that concept in context in a graph tab

- **Concept Suggestion (Keyword Matching)**
  - When creating an annotation, Orca suggests existing concepts that match the selected text using pg_trgm trigram matching (same infrastructure as the existing search field)
  - User can accept a suggestion or manually search for a different concept to attach
  - **Future:** Semantic similarity suggestions via pgvector embeddings when the corpus is large enough

- **Bidirectional Linking — External Links Page (Corpus/Document Section)**
  - When an edge is attached as an annotation, the document (within its corpus) appears in that edge's **External Links** page in a "Document Annotations" section (separate from the "Web Links" section built in Phase 6)
  - Documents are **grouped by corpus** — each corpus that contains documents annotated with this concept appears as a collapsible group
  - Each document entry shows: document title, a snippet of the annotated text, and a link to jump to the annotation
  - **Clicking a corpus** opens that corpus as a standalone corpus tab (inline with other tabs in the tab bar)
  - **Clicking a doc** within a corpus opens that corpus tab and automatically navigates to the document, scrolling to the annotation of this concept
  - Users can vote on specific document annotations using the `annotation_votes` table (Phase 7f — ✅ IMPLEMENTED) — these votes drive sort order

- **Corpus/Document Sort Modes (External Links Page)**
  - Three sort modes for the corpus/document section:
    1. **By votes** (default) — Corpuses ordered by their top document's annotation vote count; documents within each corpus also sorted by annotation votes descending
    2. **By newest annotation** — Corpuses ordered by their most recently annotated document (for this concept); documents within each corpus also sorted by annotation recency
    3. **By subscriber count** — Corpuses ordered by number of subscribers; documents within each corpus sorted by annotation votes descending
  - **Corpus groups are atomic in sorting** — all documents in a corpus stay together regardless of sort mode. A lower-voted or older document remains within its corpus group even if individually it would rank below docs in other corpuses. The corpus group's position is determined by its top-ranked document (for votes/new sorts) or subscriber count.
  - Within each corpus group, if multiple documents have this concept annotated, they are ordered by the active sort's secondary criterion (votes for modes 1 and 3, recency for mode 2)

- **Database:** New `document_annotations` table:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE document_annotations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    corpus_id INTEGER REFERENCES corpuses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    document_id INTEGER REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    start_position INTEGER NOT NULL,
    end_position INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  );
  ```

### ✅ Completed (Phase 7e) — Decontextualized Document View + Add Existing Document

- **Backend: Cross-Corpus Annotations Endpoint**
  - `GET /api/corpuses/annotations/document/:documentId` — returns ALL annotations for a document across ALL corpuses, guest-accessible
  - Duplicate merging: annotations with the same text range (start_position + end_position) and same edge_id in multiple corpuses are merged into a single entry with a `corpuses` array listing all corpus attributions
  - Response includes `totalAnnotations` (raw count) and `uniqueAnnotations` (after merging)

- **Backend: Document Search Endpoint**
  - `GET /api/corpuses/documents/search?q=QUERY&excludeCorpusId=N` — searches documents by title using case-insensitive partial match (ILIKE)
  - Excludes documents already in the specified corpus
  - Returns up to 10 results, each with a list of corpuses the document currently belongs to
  - Used by the "Add Existing Document" UI in both CorpusDetailView and CorpusTabContent

- **Frontend: DecontextualizedDocView Component (NEW)**
  - Read-only document viewer showing ALL annotations from ALL corpuses
  - Blue-tinted annotation highlights (vs gold in contextualized view) to visually distinguish the mode
  - Multi-corpus annotations shown with dashed underline
  - Right-side detail panel shows full concept path, "Navigate to concept →" button, and corpus attribution section listing every corpus where the annotation exists
  - Each corpus in the panel is clickable — subscribes to the corpus and switches to its tab with the document auto-opened
  - "All corpuses view" badge and "read-only" notice displayed in header
  - "In corpuses:" links in the document info header are clickable, opening that corpus tab

- **Frontend: "All Corpuses View" Toggle (CorpusTabContent)**
  - Blue pill button appears in the contextualized document viewer header when the document exists in 2+ corpuses
  - Clicking switches to DecontextualizedDocView; back button returns to the contextualized view within the same corpus

- **Frontend: Clickable Corpus Links (CorpusTabContent)**
  - "In corpuses:" list in document info header now has clickable links for non-current corpuses
  - Clicking subscribes to that corpus and opens the document there via the pending document pattern

- **Frontend: "Add Existing Document" UI (CorpusDetailView + CorpusTabContent)**
  - "+ Add Existing Document" button appears next to "+ Upload Document" for corpus owners
  - Opens a search panel: type a document title, press Enter or click Search
  - Results show document title, format, uploader, date, and which corpuses the document is already in
  - Documents already in the current corpus are excluded from results
  - "+ Add" button on each result adds the document to the corpus immediately
  - Available in both CorpusDetailView (Corpuses overlay) and CorpusTabContent (corpus tabs)

- **Prop Threading**
  - `onOpenCorpusTab` prop added to CorpusTabContent (passed from AppShell as `handleSubscribeToCorpus`)
  - DecontextualizedDocView receives: `documentId`, `onBack`, `onOpenCorpusTab`, `onOpenConceptTab`, `backLabel`

- **Files Changed**
  - `corpusController.js` — 2 new endpoints: `getAllDocumentAnnotations`, `searchDocuments`
  - `corpuses.js` routes — 2 new routes: `GET /annotations/document/:documentId`, `GET /documents/search`
  - `api.js` frontend — 2 new API methods: `getAllDocumentAnnotations`, `searchDocuments`
  - New `DecontextualizedDocView.jsx` — full read-only cross-corpus annotation viewer
  - `CorpusTabContent.jsx` — decontextualized view toggle, clickable corpus links, add-existing-document UI
  - `CorpusDetailView.jsx` — add-existing-document UI
  - `AppShell.jsx` — passes `onOpenCorpusTab` to CorpusTabContent

#### Phase 7e: Decontextualized Document View — ✅ COMPLETE

- **Cross-Corpus Annotation View**
  - Full specification is in Phase 7c under "Document View — Decontextualized"
  - Key behavior: shows ALL annotations from ALL corpuses, one at a time in a right-side panel, with corpus attribution and clickable corpus links to jump into corpus tabs
  - This view is **read-only** — no voting, no adding annotations
  - **Duplicate annotation handling:** If the exact same text range is associated with the exact same edge in multiple corpuses, all corpuses are listed together on that annotation's panel entry (each clickable)

### ✅ Completed (Phase 7f) — Annotation Voting, Color Set Voting, Corpus Tab Grouping

- **Backend: Annotation Votes (7f-1)**
  - `annotation_votes` table: `UNIQUE(user_id, annotation_id)`, index on `annotation_id`
  - `POST /annotations/vote` — endorse an annotation (insert or no-op on conflict), returns updated `voteCount`
  - `POST /annotations/unvote` — remove endorsement, returns updated `voteCount`
  - `getDocumentAnnotations` query updated to include `vote_count` and `user_voted` per annotation (uses subquery for count, EXISTS for user status)

- **Backend: Color Set Voting (7f-2)**
  - `annotation_color_set_votes` table: `UNIQUE(user_id, annotation_id)`, stores `vote_set_key` (sorted comma-separated edge IDs)
  - `POST /annotations/color-set/vote` — upsert user's preferred vote set key, returns all color set votes grouped by key
  - `POST /annotations/color-set/unvote` — remove preference, returns remaining votes
  - `GET /annotations/:annotationId/color-sets` — guest-accessible, returns grouped votes + user's current preference

- **Backend: Corpus Tab Grouping**
  - `group_id` column added to `corpus_subscriptions` table (nullable FK to `tab_groups`, `ON DELETE SET NULL`)
  - `getMySubscriptions` now returns `group_id` in response
  - `addTabToGroup` / `removeTabFromGroup` / `deleteTabGroup` in votesController updated to handle `tabType === 'corpus'` via `corpus_subscriptions` table

- **Frontend: Annotation Voting UI (7f-1)**
  - Annotation detail sidebar shows vote button: △ (unvoted) / ▲ (voted) with count and "endorsements" label
  - Guest users see read-only vote count (no button)
  - Annotation highlights show small amber vote count badge (superscript) when vote_count > 0
  - Local state updates optimistically on vote/unvote (annotations array + selectedAnnotation)

- **Frontend: Color Set Picker (7f-2)**
  - "🎨 Color set preference" button in annotation detail sidebar (below vote button, above navigate button)
  - Clicking fetches both the concept's vote sets (`getVoteSets`) and existing color set votes (`getAnnotationColorSets`) in parallel
  - Shows clickable color swatches from the VoteSetBar palette (imports `getSetColor`)
  - Selected swatch gets outline highlight; clicking again removes preference
  - Shows "Your preference: [color name]" and "Leading: [color name] (N votes)" when applicable
  - Empty state message when the concept has no children vote sets (needs 2+ users saving same children)
  - Resets when changing selected annotation

- **Frontend: Corpus Tab Grouping**
  - Corpus tabs now load `group_id` from subscription data
  - `buildTabBarItems` places grouped corpus tabs inside their group (ungrouped ones remain at top)
  - New `renderCorpusTabButton` function with right-click context menu support (Add to group / Remove from group)
  - `handleAddTabToGroup` / `handleRemoveTabFromGroup` / `handleDeleteGroup` all handle `tabType === 'corpus'`
  - `groupContainsActiveTab` checks corpus tabs
  - Context menu renders group actions for corpus tabs

- **Frontend: Auto-Group on Navigate-to-Concept**
  - `handleOpenConceptTab` accepts optional 5th parameter `sourceCorpusTabId`
  - When called from CorpusTabContent annotation sidebar, passes the corpus tab ID
  - If corpus tab is already in a group → new graph tab joins the same group
  - If corpus tab is ungrouped → creates a new group named after the corpus, adds both corpus tab and graph tab to it
  - Other callers (Concept page, Saved page) pass no 5th arg → no grouping (backward compatible)

- **Frontend: Document Persistence on Tab Switch**
  - Corpus tabs now render like graph tabs: all mounted simultaneously, hidden with `display: none` when inactive
  - Previously, only the active corpus tab rendered (conditional mount), causing document state to reset when switching tabs
  - Now switching to a graph tab and back to a corpus tab preserves the open document, scroll position, selected annotation, etc.

- **Files Changed (7f-1 + 7f-2 combined)**
  - `migrate.js` — 2 new tables (`annotation_votes`, `annotation_color_set_votes`), `group_id` column on `corpus_subscriptions`
  - `corpusController.js` — `getDocumentAnnotations` updated with vote_count/user_voted; `getMySubscriptions` returns group_id; 5 new endpoints (voteOnAnnotation, unvoteAnnotation, voteAnnotationColorSet, unvoteAnnotationColorSet, getAnnotationColorSets)
  - `votesController.js` — `addTabToGroup`, `removeTabFromGroup`, `deleteTabGroup` updated for corpus tab type
  - `corpuses.js` routes — 5 new routes for annotation voting + color set voting
  - `api.js` frontend — 5 new API methods
  - `CorpusTabContent.jsx` — annotation vote handlers + UI, color set handlers + picker UI, imports `getSetColor`
  - `AppShell.jsx` — corpus tab grouping, auto-group on navigate, document persistence (display:none rendering), renderCorpusTabButton, context menu for corpus tabs

#### Phase 7f: Color Set Selection & Voting on Annotations — ✅ COMPLETE

- **Annotation Endorsement Voting (7f-1)**
  - On public-annotation corpuses, any logged-in user can see all annotations added by anyone
  - Users can endorse specific annotations (endorsing the connection between that text and that edge)
  - Annotation votes use the same simple endorsement model as web link upvotes (one vote per user per annotation)
  - Vote count displayed on annotation highlights (small amber badge) and in the annotation detail sidebar

- **Color Set Selection (Deferred, Not On-Creation) (7f-2)**
  - Color set selection does NOT happen during annotation creation — creation stays fast with no extra step
  - Instead, users click "🎨 Color set preference" in the annotation detail sidebar at any time
  - This fetches the annotated concept's children's vote sets and shows clickable color swatches
  - Users can navigate to the concept in a graph tab first (via "Navigate to concept →") to explore color sets, then return to the document and pick one
  - The annotator's chosen color set is the default view unless outvoted

- **Color Set Voting**
  - Other users can vote for the annotator's color set or vote for alternative color sets
  - Color set votes are per-annotation, consistent with all other voting in Orca
  - The winning color set (most votes) is displayed; annotator's choice stands if no one else votes
  - Users can change their preference at any time (upsert model)

- **Corpus Tab Grouping (UX Enhancement)**
  - Corpus tabs can now join tab groups alongside graph tabs
  - `group_id` column added to `corpus_subscriptions` table
  - Right-click context menu on corpus tabs supports group management
  - When "Navigate to concept →" is clicked from an annotation sidebar, the new graph tab is auto-grouped with the source corpus tab

- **Document Persistence on Tab Switch (UX Fix)**
  - Corpus tabs are now rendered simultaneously with `display: none` (matching graph tab pattern)
  - Open documents, scroll position, and selected annotations survive tab switching

- **Database:** `annotation_votes` table, `annotation_color_set_votes` table (both new), `group_id` column on `corpus_subscriptions`

#### Phase 7g: Combined Public/Private Model with Allowed Users

Every corpus exists in a **combined state** — it always has both a public layer and a private (allowed-users) layer. There is no binary public/private toggle.

- **Allowed Users (Corpus-Level)**
  - The corpus owner can generate an invite link to add **allowed users** to the corpus
  - Allowed users can: add documents to the corpus, add annotations, add annotation votes (including color set votes) to the **private layer** of any document in the corpus
  - Allowed users can also create new document versions (see Phase 7h: Document Versioning)
  - The allowed-user concept lives at the corpus level and applies uniformly to all documents within it
  - Allowed users can create a display username visible only within that corpus's annotation layer, only to other allowed users
  - Usernames are NOT displayed anywhere else in Orca — this was always the design intent

- **Public Layer (Always Present)**
  - Any logged-in Orca user can add annotations, votes, and color set votes to the **public layer** of any document in any corpus
  - The public layer is always visible by default

- **Private Layer Filtering**
  - Allowed users can toggle a filter to show **only** annotations, votes, and color set votes added by other allowed users of the corpus
  - This filter hides all public-layer content that wasn't contributed by allowed users
  - Non-allowed users cannot see or access the private layer — they only see the public layer

- **Allowed User Annotation Removal with Changelog**
  - Allowed users can remove annotations from documents in the corpus
  - Every removal is logged in a changelog: who removed it, when, and what the annotation was (concept, text selection, creator)
  - The changelog is visible to all allowed users of the corpus
  - This provides accountability for curation decisions within the allowed-user group

- **Corpus Owner Powers**
  - Only the corpus owner can: add/remove allowed users, remove documents from the corpus, delete the corpus
  - Corpus owners can remove docs from their corpus; the doc is only deleted if no other corpus contains it (unless uploaded by an allowed user — those are left orphaned for rescue per Phase 9b)

- **Hiding Does Not Apply to Annotations**
  - If a concept is spammy/abusive, it should be hidden at the graph level, which prevents it from being used as an annotation
  - No separate hiding mechanism needed for annotations themselves

- **Database:** New `corpus_allowed_users` table:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE corpus_allowed_users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    corpus_id INTEGER REFERENCES corpuses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    display_name VARCHAR(255),
    invited_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(corpus_id, user_id)
  );
  ```
  New `annotation_removal_log` table:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE annotation_removal_log (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    corpus_id INTEGER REFERENCES corpuses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    document_id INTEGER REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    start_position INTEGER NOT NULL,
    end_position INTEGER NOT NULL,
    original_creator INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    removed_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    removed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  );
  ```
  Annotations also need a new `layer` column:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE document_annotations ADD COLUMN layer VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'public';
  -- layer is 'public' or 'private'
  ```

#### Phase 7h: Document Versioning

Users can copy a document to a new version within the same corpus. Versions are tracked separately from the document title to avoid naming collisions.

- **Creating a New Version**
  - Any allowed user of a corpus can click a document and copy it to a new version
  - The new version is automatically added to the same corpus as the source document
  - Text content and annotations copy over from the source version
  - The new version's owner is the user who created it (not the original document's uploader)
  - The owner can edit the text content of their new version

- **Version Numbering**
  - Version numbers are stored as a separate field on the `documents` table, not embedded in the title
  - This prevents naming collisions (e.g., someone else titling a document "My Doc v2" independently)
  - Version numbers are auto-incremented per document lineage (v1, v2, v3...)
  - A `source_document_id` field tracks which document a version was copied from, forming a version chain

- **Annotation Behavior on Versioned Documents**
  - Annotations from the source document are copied to the new version at creation time
  - The owner can edit the new version's text. If editing removes or modifies the highlighted text region for an annotation, that annotation is removed from both public and private layers
  - Annotations on the new version's **public layer** cannot be directly removed by the owner — only by editing away the underlying text
  - Annotations on the **private layer** follow normal allowed-user removal rules (with changelog)

- **Document Immutability Exception**
  - Documents are still immutable once finalized — but newly created versions start in an **editable draft state** until the owner marks them as finalized
  - Once finalized, the document becomes immutable (same as all other documents), and character offsets for annotations are locked
  - This preserves the annotation offset guarantee while allowing version owners to make changes before committing

- **Database changes:**
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN version_number INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1;
  ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN source_document_id INTEGER REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
  -- is_draft column was added in Phase 7h and removed in Phase 21a
  ```

### ✅ Completed (Phase 7i-1 + 7i-2) — Concept Linking Backend & Underline Display

- **Backend: `POST /api/concepts/find-in-text` Endpoint (7i-1)**
  - Accepts `{ text }` in the POST body, returns all concept names found as whole words in the text
  - Loads all concepts sorted by name length descending (longer matches take priority)
  - Uses regex with `\b` word boundaries for case-insensitive whole-word matching
  - Escapes regex special characters in concept names
  - Returns non-overlapping matches sorted by position (earlier/longer match wins)
  - Each match includes `conceptId`, `conceptName`, `start`, `end` (character offsets)
  - Guest-accessible via `optionalAuth`
  - No database migration required — reads from existing `concepts` table

- **Frontend: Concept Link Underlines on Finalized Documents (7i-2)**
  - New state: `conceptLinks`, `conceptLinksLoading` in CorpusTabContent
  - `handleOpenDocument` calls `loadConceptLinks(doc.body)` for finalized (non-draft) documents
  - `buildAnnotatedBody` rewritten to weave concept link underlines into plain-text gaps between annotations — annotations always take priority over concept links
  - New `addTextWithConceptLinks` helper splits plain-text segments into sub-segments with `type: 'conceptLink'`
  - Rendering handles `seg.type === 'conceptLink'` with a subtle dotted underline (`borderBottom: '1px dotted rgba(100, 100, 100, 0.45)'`)
  - Clicking a concept link opens **decontextualized Flip View** in a new graph tab via `onOpenConceptTab` with `viewMode: 'flip'`
  - Concept links cleared on back navigation to document list

- **AppShell: `handleOpenConceptTab` viewMode Parameter**
  - `handleOpenConceptTab` now accepts optional 6th parameter `viewMode` (default: `'children'`)
  - Both guest and logged-in code paths use `effectiveViewMode` instead of hardcoded `'children'`
  - `tabType` logic changed from `path.length === 0 ? 'root' : 'concept'` to `conceptId ? 'concept' : 'root'` — ensures a concept with no path context (decontextualized) still creates a `'concept'` type tab
  - Wrapper arrow function on CorpusTabContent's `onOpenConceptTab` prop updated to pass `viewMode` through (was previously silently dropping it)

- **Bug Fix: Version Creation Across Corpuses (Phase 7h)**
  - `createVersion` no longer requires the source document to be in the requesting corpus — supports cross-corpus version history navigation
  - New versions are auto-added to ALL corpuses the source document belongs to (via loop over `corpus_documents` rows with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`)
  - Current corpus also gets the new version as a safety net (in case source was reached via version history from a corpus it wasn't in)

- Files changed: `conceptsController.js` (new `findConceptsInText` endpoint), `concepts.js` routes (new `POST /find-in-text` route), `api.js` frontend (new `findConceptsInText` API method), `CorpusTabContent.jsx` (concept link state, loading, segment building, rendering, click handler), `AppShell.jsx` (`handleOpenConceptTab` viewMode parameter, tabType logic fix, wrapper arrow function fix), `corpusController.js` (`createVersion` cross-corpus fix)

### ✅ Completed (Phase 7i-3) — Disambiguation Picker — SKIPPED

- **Decision:** Disambiguation is unnecessary under the current data model. Concept names are globally unique in the `concepts` table — the same text string maps to exactly one concept row. Different attributes ([action], [tool], [value], [question]) exist on edges, not on the concept itself. The decontextualized Flip View already shows all attribute contexts for a concept, which aligns better with Orca's creative exploration philosophy (showing users more rather than forcing them to narrow down upfront).

### ✅ Completed (Phase 7i-4) — Live Concept Linking During Draft Editing & Upload

- **Debounced Live Matching**
  - New state: `draftConceptLinks` (for draft editing), `uploadConceptLinks` (for document upload)
  - Two `useEffect` hooks with 500ms debounce timers that call `findConceptsInText` when `draftBody` or `uploadBody` changes
  - Auto-clear when respective mode is exited (save, cancel, upload complete, back-to-list)

- **Preview Panels**
  - New `buildConceptLinkSegments(text, links)` helper — takes raw text and concept link matches, returns array of `{ type: 'text' }` and `{ type: 'conceptLink' }` segments
  - **Draft editing:** Below the textarea and action buttons, a "Concept links found (N)" preview panel shows the full text with dotted underlines on matched concepts. Clickable — opens decontextualized Flip View.
  - **Upload form:** Same preview panel between the Upload button and the duplicate matches panel
  - Preview body has max 200px height with scroll, uses same `conceptLinkUnderline` style as finalized document underlines

- **Finalization Trigger**
  - After `handleFinalizeDraft` completes, concept links are loaded for the now-finalized document so underlines appear immediately without a page refresh

- Files changed: `CorpusTabContent.jsx` (new state variables, debounced effects, buildConceptLinkSegments helper, preview panel JSX in both draft editing and upload sections, cleanup in save/cancel/back handlers, conceptLinkPreview styles)

### ✅ Completed (Phase 7i-5) — Concept Link Caching for Finalized Documents

- **New Table: `document_concept_links_cache`**
  - Stores pre-computed concept link matches for finalized (immutable) documents
  - Columns: `document_id` (FK), `concept_id`, `concept_name`, `start_position`, `end_position`, `computed_at`
  - Indexed on `document_id` for fast lookups

- **New Endpoint: `GET /api/concepts/document-links/:documentId`**
  - Checks if document is finalized (drafts return empty — frontend uses `findConceptsInText` directly for those)
  - If cached entries exist, compares `computed_at` against `MAX(concepts.created_at)` — if no newer concepts exist, serves from cache
  - If cache is stale or missing, recomputes using same regex matching logic as `findConceptsInText`, stores results in cache (atomic DELETE + INSERT in transaction), returns results
  - Guest-accessible via `optionalAuth`
  - Graceful degradation: if cache write fails, computed results are still served

- **Frontend: `loadConceptLinks` Updated**
  - `loadConceptLinks` now takes `documentId` instead of `bodyText` and calls the cached `getDocumentConceptLinks` endpoint
  - Both call sites updated: `handleOpenDocument` (document open) and `handleFinalizeDraft` (post-finalization)
  - Live linking during editing (7i-4) still uses `findConceptsInText` directly — only finalized documents use the cache

- Files changed: `migrate.js` (new `document_concept_links_cache` table), `conceptsController.js` (new `getDocumentConceptLinks` endpoint), `concepts.js` routes (new `GET /document-links/:documentId` route), `api.js` frontend (new `getDocumentConceptLinks` API method), `CorpusTabContent.jsx` (`loadConceptLinks` updated to use cached endpoint by document ID)

### Phase 7i: COMPLETE ✅

### ✅ Completed (Phase 7c Saved Page Overhaul) — Corpus-Based Save Grouping

- **Saved Page Auto-Grouping by Corpus**
  - The Saved Page now automatically groups saves into tabs based on corpus annotation membership
  - No more manual tab picker on the ▲ save button — clicking ▲ just saves, placement is automatic
  - One tab per corpus that has matching saves (subscribed or unsubscribed), plus an "Uncategorized" tab for saves not in any corpus
  - Unsubscribed corpus tabs show an "unsubscribed" badge and italic styling
  - An edge belongs to a corpus if it (or any descendant saved edge) has an annotation in that corpus
  - The backend propagates corpus associations upward from annotated edges to ancestor saved edges

- **New Backend Endpoint: `GET /api/votes/saved-by-corpus`**
  - Returns all user saves grouped by corpus (via annotation lookup), with an uncategorized bucket
  - Step 1: fetch all user saves (same query as `getUserSaves`)
  - Step 2: find all annotations on saved edges via `document_annotations`
  - Step 3: propagate corpus associations upward through ancestor saved edges
  - Step 4: group edges by corpus, look up corpus names and subscription status
  - Response: `{ corpusTabs: [{ corpusId, corpusName, isSubscribed, edges }], uncategorizedEdges, conceptNames }`

- **New Database Table: `saved_tree_order_v2`**
  - Replaces `saved_tree_order` (which keyed on `saved_tab_id` from the retired manual tabs)
  - Keyed on `(user_id, corpus_id, root_concept_id)` — NULL corpus_id for Uncategorized tab
  - Uses PostgreSQL partial unique indexes to handle NULL vs non-NULL corpus_id
  - New endpoints: `GET /tree-order-v2`, `POST /tree-order-v2/update`

- **Simplified Save Flow (Tab Picker Removed)**
  - `addVote` no longer accepts `tabId` parameter
  - `vote_tab_links` insertion removed from save flow (backwards-compat linking to first tab retained during transition)
  - `ConceptGrid.jsx` tab picker dropdown removed entirely; `userTabs` prop removed
  - `Root.jsx` and `Concept.jsx` no longer accept or thread `savedTabs` prop
  - `AppShell.jsx` no longer passes `savedTabs` to Root/Concept components

- **Rewritten Components**
  - `SavedPageOverlay.jsx` — completely rewritten: loads saves via `getUserSavesByCorpus`, auto-generates corpus tabs + uncategorized tab, passes pre-grouped edges to `SavedTabContent`
  - `SavedTabContent.jsx` — rewritten to receive edges as props (instead of fetching internally), uses v2 tree ordering keyed by `corpusId`
  - Unsaving from the Saved Page uses `removeVote` (full unsave with cascade) and reloads all data since unsaving affects corpus grouping

- **Tables Functionally Retired (Still in DB)**
  - `saved_tabs` — no longer drives tab organization (tabs are now auto-generated from corpus membership)
  - `vote_tab_links` — no longer used for save organization (saves are grouped dynamically)
  - `saved_tree_order` — replaced by `saved_tree_order_v2`
  - These tables remain in the database for backwards compatibility but are no longer actively written to by the new code path

- Files changed: `migrate.js` (new `saved_tree_order_v2` table with partial unique indexes), `votesController.js` (new `getUserSavesByCorpus` endpoint, `getTreeOrderV2`/`updateTreeOrderV2` endpoints, simplified `addVote` removing tabId), `votes.js` routes (3 new routes: `saved-by-corpus`, `tree-order-v2`, `tree-order-v2/update`), `api.js` frontend (new `getUserSavesByCorpus`/`getTreeOrderV2`/`updateTreeOrderV2` methods, simplified `addVote` signature), `SavedPageOverlay.jsx` (complete rewrite for corpus-based tabs), `SavedTabContent.jsx` (rewritten to receive edges as props + v2 tree order), `ConceptGrid.jsx` (tab picker removed, `userTabs` prop removed), `AppShell.jsx` (`savedTabs` prop removed from Root/Concept), `Root.jsx` (`savedTabs` prop removed, `handleVote` simplified), `Concept.jsx` (`savedTabs` prop removed, `userTabs` state removed, `handleVote` simplified)

### ✅ Completed (Post-Phase 7 cleanup) — Dead Code Removal, Document Favoriting, Search Corpus Annotations

- **Dead `savedTabs` Code Removed from AppShell**
  - `savedTabs` / `setSavedTabs` state removed entirely
  - `votesAPI.getUserTabs()` call removed from `loadAllTabs` (saves one API call per page load)
  - `savedTabs` removed from `useCallback` dependency array
  - `tabType === 'saved'` branches removed from `handleDeleteGroup`, `handleAddTabToGroup`, `handleRemoveTabFromGroup`
  - Files changed: `AppShell.jsx`

- **Per-Corpus Document Favoriting**
  - New `document_favorites` table: `UNIQUE(user_id, corpus_id, document_id)`
  - ☆/★ star button on each document card in corpus tabs (not visible to guests)
  - Clicking toggles favorite — favorited docs sort to the top of the document list
  - Per-corpus: favoriting in Corpus A doesn't affect the doc's position in Corpus B
  - Warm amber (goldenrod) color for filled star, consistent with Orca's design language
  - Backend: `toggleDocumentFavorite` (toggle insert/delete), `getDocumentFavorites` (returns list of favorited doc IDs)
  - Frontend: favorites loaded on corpus load, optimistic state update on toggle, sort applied client-side
  - Files changed: `migrate.js` (new `document_favorites` table), `corpusController.js` (2 new endpoints), `corpuses.js` routes (2 new routes), `api.js` frontend (2 new API methods), `CorpusTabContent.jsx` (favorite state, toggle handler, star button, sort logic)

- **Search Results Surface Corpus Annotations**
  - When a logged-in user searches, results that appear as annotations in their subscribed corpuses now show a 📚 badge with corpus names
  - Backend: new query joins `document_annotations` → `edges` → `corpuses` → `corpus_subscriptions` to find which search results have annotations in subscribed corpuses
  - Returns `corpusAnnotations` array per result: `[{ corpusId, corpusName }, ...]`
  - Sort updated: results with saved tabs OR corpus annotations float to the top (previously only saved tabs)
  - Frontend: section header changed from "In your saved tabs" to "In your saves / corpuses"
  - Corpus badge uses subtle blue-tinted background (`#e8e8f0`), visually distinct from green saved-tab badges (`#e8f0e8`)
  - Both badges can appear on the same result if a concept is both saved and annotated in a corpus
  - Files changed: `conceptsController.js` (new corpus annotation query in `searchConcepts`, updated sort logic), `SearchField.jsx` (corpus badge rendering, updated section header/divider logic, new `corpusBadge` style)

### ✅ Completed (Phase 8) — Inactive Corpus Tab Dormancy

Replaces the original "inactive user filtering" concept. Instead of tracking user-level activity, Orca tracks **per-corpus-tab** activity on the Saved Page. Corpus tabs that haven't been opened for 30 days go dormant via a background job. A simplified dormancy model excludes all of a user's votes from public save totals only when every one of their tabs is dormant.

- **Phase 8a: Backend Infrastructure**
  - New `saved_page_tab_activity` table with `UNIQUE(user_id, corpus_id)` constraint and partial unique index for NULL corpus_id (Uncategorized tab)
  - Migration backfills activity rows for all existing users (`last_opened_at = NOW()`) so nobody is instantly dormant
  - Required `NULL::INTEGER` cast for PostgreSQL type inference in the backfill INSERT (bare `NULL` caused a "column is of type integer but expression is of type text" error)
  - 3 new endpoints: `GET /tab-activity`, `POST /tab-activity/record`, `POST /tab-activity/revive`
  - New `check-dormancy.js` background job script — marks tabs dormant when `last_opened_at` is older than 30 days
  - New npm script: `npm run check-dormancy` (meant to be run via cron/Task Scheduler daily)
  - Files changed: `migrate.js`, `votesController.js`, `votes.js` routes, `package.json`, new `check-dormancy.js`

- **Phase 8b: Save Count Exclusion**
  - `DORMANT_USERS_SUBQUERY` constant defined in both `conceptsController.js` and `votesController.js` — reusable SQL snippet that finds users where ALL `saved_page_tab_activity` rows have `is_dormant = true`
  - **Architecture Decision #43 — Simplified Dormancy Model:** A user's votes are excluded from ALL public save counts if and only if every one of their `saved_page_tab_activity` rows is dormant. If even one tab is active, all votes count everywhere. Users with zero activity rows are NOT dormant. This avoids per-edge, per-corpus filtering complexity while still achieving inactive-user vote suppression.
  - Filter applied to 13 queries total: root page save counts, children save counts, current edge vote count (root + non-root), flip view (contextual + exploratory), vote set membership, addVote/removeVote/removeVoteFromTab response counts, getUserSaves (tab-filtered + unfiltered), getUserSavesByCorpus
  - Move, swap, and link votes are unaffected — only save vote counts are filtered
  - Files changed: `conceptsController.js`, `votesController.js`

- **Phase 8c: Frontend — Activity Tracking, Dormancy Display & Revival**
  - 3 new API methods in `api.js`: `getTabActivity`, `recordTabActivity`, `reviveTabActivity`
  - `SavedPageOverlay.jsx` rewritten with dormancy support:
    - Loads saves and tab activity in parallel on mount
    - Records activity when switching to a non-dormant tab (keeps it active)
    - Dormant tabs dimmed to 45% opacity with gray "dormant" badge
    - Smart initial tab selection: picks first non-dormant tab; if all dormant, shows "All your saved tabs are dormant" message
    - Clicking a dormant tab opens a revival modal: "Revive my votes" or "View without reviving"
    - "View without reviving" shows tab contents with a persistent info bar and inline "Revive" button
    - `allTabsDormant` computed flag drives context-aware messaging: if all tabs dormant, modal says "your save votes are currently not counted"; if only some dormant, says "your votes still count because you have other active tabs"
  - Styling follows Orca's Zen aesthetic: EB Garamond serif font, off-white modal, black/gray tones, warm amber for dormant info bar
  - Files changed: `api.js`, `SavedPageOverlay.jsx`

### Phase 9: Corpus Deletion & Orphan Rescue

#### Phase 9a: Corpus Subscriptions — ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED (Phase 7c)

Corpus subscriptions were built in Phase 7c. This sub-phase is retained for reference only.

- **Corpus Subscriptions**
  - Users can subscribe to any corpus
  - **Subscribing adds the corpus as a persistent tab** in the main tab bar (see Phase 7c "Corpus Tabs Are Persistent")
  - **Subscribing also creates a corresponding corpus tab on the Saved Page** (but only if the user has saves associated with that corpus — otherwise only the main tab bar tab appears)
  - Unsubscribing removes the corpus from the main tab bar; any saves associated with that corpus remain on the Saved Page in an "Unsubscribed" corpus tab until the user removes those saves
  - Subscriber count is displayed on corpus listings (e.g., in "View in other corpuses")

#### Phase 9b: Corpus Deletion with Orphan Rescue — ✅ COMPLETE

When a corpus is deleted (or a document is removed from a corpus), orphaned documents uploaded by allowed users are no longer auto-deleted. Instead they persist in the database with zero corpus memberships until the author rescues or dismisses them.

- **Modified Corpus Deletion (`deleteCorpus` in `corpusController.js`)**
  - Before deleting, identifies documents that will become orphaned (in this corpus only, not in any other)
  - Checks each orphan's `uploaded_by` against `corpus_allowed_users` for the corpus
  - If uploader is an allowed user (not the corpus owner): document is left orphaned (not deleted)
  - If uploader is the corpus owner (or not an allowed user): document is deleted as before
  - Response includes `documentsAwaitingRescue` count alongside existing `orphanedDocumentsRemoved`

- **Modified Document Removal (`removeDocumentFromCorpus` in `corpusController.js`)**
  - Same orphan rescue logic applied when removing a single document from a corpus
  - Also now deletes annotations for the document within the corpus before removing the link
  - Response includes `documentOrphaned` boolean alongside existing `documentDeleted`

- **Three New Backend Endpoints**
  - `GET /api/corpuses/orphaned-documents` — returns orphaned documents uploaded by the current user (documents with zero `corpus_documents` rows)
  - `POST /api/corpuses/rescue-document` — adds an orphaned document to a chosen corpus (user must own the doc and be owner/allowed user of the target corpus)
  - `POST /api/corpuses/dismiss-orphan` — permanently deletes an orphaned document (user must own the doc, doc must have zero corpus memberships)

- **Frontend: Orphan Rescue Modal (`OrphanRescueModal.jsx`)**
  - On app load, AppShell checks for orphaned documents (logged-in users only, non-blocking)
  - If orphans exist, modal pops up automatically listing each orphaned document
  - Per document: dropdown to select a target corpus (user's own corpuses + subscribed corpuses), "Rescue" button, "Dismiss" button
  - Inline "Create a new corpus" flow within the modal for users who need a new corpus to rescue into
  - "Dismiss all" button for bulk deletion (with confirmation prompt)
  - "Decide later" closes the modal; orphans persist and modal reappears on next app load
  - No expiry timer or background job — orphaned documents sit indefinitely until the user acts

- **Design Decisions**
  - No `pending_orphan_rescues` table needed — orphaned documents are simply documents with zero rows in `corpus_documents`, queried on the fly
  - No rescue window or expiry — simplifies implementation significantly vs. the original spec's deferred-deletion approach
  - Only `uploaded_by` is checked for rescue eligibility (not `added_by`) — covers the case where the actual author might lose their work
  - Zombie documents (orphans from users who never log in again) are negligible and can be cleaned up manually if needed

- **Files Changed**
  - `corpusController.js` — modified `deleteCorpus` and `removeDocumentFromCorpus`, added 3 new functions (`getOrphanedDocuments`, `rescueOrphanedDocument`, `dismissOrphanedDocument`)
  - `routes/corpuses.js` — 3 new routes (before parameterized `/:id` routes)
  - `api.js` frontend — 3 new methods on `corpusAPI` (`getOrphanedDocuments`, `rescueDocument`, `dismissOrphan`)
  - New `OrphanRescueModal.jsx` component
  - `AppShell.jsx` — import + state + mount useEffect for orphan check + modal rendering

### ✅ Completed (Phase 10) — Editorial Layer Rename + Quick Fixes

Small but important cleanup phase that addressed accumulated design debt.

- **Phase 10a: Rename "Private" Layer to "Editorial"**
  - Database migration: `UPDATE document_annotations SET layer = 'editorial' WHERE layer = 'private'`; same for `annotation_removal_log.annotation_layer`
  - **Visibility change:** Editorial-layer annotations are now visible to ALL users. Any user can read them and filter to see the editorial view. Only allowed users can *create* or *vote on* editorial-layer annotations.
  - Backend: `createAnnotation` accepts `'editorial'` instead of `'private'`; `getDocumentAnnotations` no longer hides editorial annotations from non-allowed users (removed `canSeePrivate` filtering); `deleteAnnotation` error messages updated; `voteOnAnnotation` and `voteAnnotationColorSet` now check editorial-layer permission (only allowed users can vote on editorial annotations)
  - Frontend: Layer filter toggle visible to ALL logged-in users (was restricted to allowed users); filter button text "Private" → "Editorial"; annotation highlights use `annotationHighlightEditorial` style (same green tint); layer badge shows "editorial"; annotation vote/color-set buttons hidden for non-allowed users on editorial annotations; read-only vote count shown for non-allowed users on editorial annotations
  - `AnnotationPanel.jsx`: header text "(private layer)" → "(editorial layer)"
  - Files changed: `migrate.js`, `corpusController.js`, `CorpusTabContent.jsx`, `AnnotationPanel.jsx`

- **Phase 10b: Remove Public/Private Toggle from Corpus Creation**
  - Removed `newMode` state and "Annotation mode: Public / Private" toggle from corpus creation form in `CorpusListView.jsx`
  - Hardcoded `'public'` in `corpusAPI.create()` call
  - Removed `annotation_mode` badge from corpus cards in the list (no longer meaningful)
  - Cleaned up 5 unused style objects (`modeRow`, `modeLabel`, `modeButton`, `modeButtonActive`, `modeBadge`)
  - The `annotation_mode` column on `corpuses` remains functionally retired (not dropped); creation defaults to `'public'` harmlessly
  - Files changed: `CorpusListView.jsx`

- **Phase 10c: Dormancy Warning on Login**
  - On AppShell mount (for logged-in users), calls `votesAPI.getTabActivity()` and counts dormant tabs
  - If any dormant tabs exist, shows a warm amber-tinted dismissable banner between the header and tab bar
  - Banner text: "You have X dormant saved tab(s). Visit them to confirm you still endorse these concepts."
  - Clicking the banner text opens the Saved Page overlay and dismisses the banner
  - ✕ button dismisses the banner; does not reappear until next login/page refresh (state-based, not persisted)
  - Frontend-only change — uses existing `getTabActivity` endpoint (response field: `res.data.activity`, dormant flag: `isDormant` camelCase)
  - Files changed: `AppShell.jsx`

### ✅ Completed (Phase 11) — Sort by Annotation Count

Adds a third sort option for child concepts: sort by how many corpus documents contain the child concept as an annotation.

- **Sort Dropdown UI** *(Note: dropdown replaced by flat horizontal toggle row in Phase 29c)*
  - Originally replaced the old cycling sort button with a `<select>` dropdown on both Root page and Concept page
  - Three options at Phase 11: `↓ Saves` (default), `↓ New`, `↓ Annotations` (fourth option `Top Annotation` added in Phase 29b; dropdown converted to flat button row in Phase 29c)
  - Frontend state changed from boolean `sortByNew` to string `sortMode` ('saves' | 'new' | 'annotations' | 'top_annotation')

- **Backend: `sort=annotations` Query Parameter**
  - `getRootConcepts`: Conditional `LEFT JOIN document_annotations da ON da.edge_id = root_e.id` and `COUNT(DISTINCT da.document_id) as annotation_count` — only added when `sort=annotations`
  - `getConceptWithChildren`: Same conditional join pattern on child edges
  - Order clause: `annotation_count DESC, vote_count DESC, c.name` (tiebreaker is save count, then alphabetical)
  - Conditional join avoids unnecessary overhead when sorting by saves or new

- **Files Changed**
  - `conceptsController.js` — conditional annotation join/select/order in `getRootConcepts` and `getConceptWithChildren`
  - `Root.jsx` — `sortByNew` boolean → `sortMode` string, button → select dropdown, new `sortSelect`/`sortSelectActive` styles
  - `Concept.jsx` — same `sortByNew` → `sortMode` refactor, button → select dropdown, matching styles

### ✅ Completed (Phase 12a) — Nested Corpus Infrastructure

- **Single-parent model:** `parent_corpus_id` column added to `corpuses` table (nullable, self-referencing FK with `ON DELETE SET NULL`). Simpler than the originally spec'd multi-parent junction table — a corpus can have only one parent. If someone needs a corpus accessible from two places, they can add the same documents to two separate corpuses.
- **Index on `parent_corpus_id`** for fast child lookups
- **Cycle prevention:** `isAncestor()` helper walks up the parent chain before allowing a new nesting link. Rejects if adding the link would create A→B→...→A loops.
- **Permission model:** Parent corpus owner AND allowed users can add/remove sub-corpuses (parallels document management)
- **Independent permissions:** Nesting is purely organizational — being an allowed user of a parent does NOT grant access to sub-corpuses
- **`createCorpus` updated** to accept optional `parentCorpusId` parameter (validates parent exists and user has permission)
- **`listCorpuses` and `getCorpus` updated** to return `parent_corpus_id` in response; `getCorpus` also returns `childCorpuses` array
- **4 new backend endpoints:** `POST /:parentId/add-subcorpus`, `POST /:parentId/remove-subcorpus`, `GET /:id/children`, `GET /:id/tree` (recursive CTE)
- **`corpus_subscriptions.group_id` retired:** Migration clears all existing values. Corpus tabs are now positioned by the tree structure, not flat groups.
- Files changed: `migrate.js`, `corpusController.js`, `corpuses.js` routes, `api.js` frontend

### ✅ Completed (Phase 12b) — Sidebar Redesign (⚠️ Superseded by Phase 19b/19c)

A major UI restructuring that replaces the horizontal tab bar with a vertical sidebar. **Note:** The three-section layout (CORPUSES / GRAPH GROUPS / GRAPHS) described below was replaced in Phase 19b with a single unified list, and drag-and-drop was added in Phase 19c.

- **Layout change:** `header → horizontal tab bar → content` replaced with `header → (sidebar + content)`. The sidebar is 220px wide on the left; the content area fills the rest.
- **Sidebar structure (three sections):**
  1. **Top:** "Saved" and "📚 Browse" action buttons (moved from the header)
  2. **Middle (scrollable tree):** Three labeled sections — **CORPUSES** (subscribed corpus tabs with 📚 icons, expandable for placed graph tabs and future sub-corpuses), **GRAPH GROUPS** (flat expandable groups containing graph tabs), **GRAPHS** (ungrouped, unplaced graph tabs with ⬡ icons)
  3. **Bottom:** "« Hide" button to collapse the sidebar
- **Active item highlighting:** Left border highlight + bold text (replaces old bottom-border active tab)
- **Collapsible sidebar:** Collapses to a thin 24px bar with a » expand button
- **Graph tabs** have a small ✕ close button; corpus tabs do not (unsubscribe to remove)
- **Tab groups** expand/collapse with ▾/▸ arrows (same functionality, now vertical layout). Rename via double-click and right-click context menus still work.
- **"+ New tab"** button at the bottom of the tree
- **Header simplified:** "Saved" and "📚 Corpuses" buttons removed from header (now in sidebar). Header shows only "orca" title + username + logout (or login/signup for guests).
- **Corpus tab context menu simplified:** Now shows only "Unsubscribe" since corpus tabs no longer participate in flat groups
- **All existing functionality preserved:** Content rendering (corpus tabs, graph tabs, overlays, modals) unchanged — only navigation presentation changed.
- Files changed: `AppShell.jsx` (complete rewrite of render section and styles)

### ✅ Completed (Phase 12c) — Graph Tab Placement in Corpus Tree

- **New `user_corpus_tab_placements` table** with `UNIQUE(user_id, graph_tab_id)` — a graph tab can be in at most one corpus per user
- **3 new backend endpoints:** `GET /votes/tab-placements`, `POST /votes/tab-placements/place` (upserts, also removes from flat group), `POST /votes/tab-placements/remove`
- **Placements loaded on mount** alongside graph tabs and groups via `Promise.all` in `loadAllTabs`
- **Right-click graph tab → "Place in corpus..."** opens a styled dropdown listing subscribed corpuses with 📚 icons. Clicking a corpus places the tab.
- **Placed graph tabs** appear indented under their corpus in the sidebar (with ⬡ icon). Corpus nodes auto-show expand arrow when they have placed graph tabs.
- **Right-click a placed graph tab** → "Remove from corpus" (returns to ungrouped GRAPHS section) or "Move to different corpus..." (reopens picker)
- **Mutual exclusion:** Placing in a corpus removes from flat group; adding to a flat group removes corpus placement. Backend handles both directions.
- **Learning: Always run `npm run migrate` before restarting the server** when new tables are added. Otherwise endpoints querying those tables fail, and `Promise.all` chains that include those endpoints will fail silently — causing unrelated data (like corpus subscriptions) to not load.
- Files changed: `migrate.js`, `votesController.js`, `votes.js` routes, `api.js`, `AppShell.jsx`

### ✅ Completed (Phase 12d) — Corpus Browsing UI Updates (⚠️ Sub-corpus UI removed in Phase 19a)

**Note:** The sub-corpus section, parent path display, and `onSelectCorpus` prop threading described below were all removed in Phase 19a when sub-corpus infrastructure was eliminated.

- **CorpusDetailView — Sub-corpuses Section**
  - New "Sub-corpuses" section appears above the Documents section when the corpus has children or the user is owner/allowed
  - Each sub-corpus card shows: 📚 name, document count, subscriber count, owner, sub-corpus count
  - Clicking a sub-corpus card navigates into that corpus's detail view (via new `onSelectCorpus` prop)
  - "✕" button removes a sub-corpus (makes it top-level) — owner/allowed only, with confirmation dialog
  - **"+ Add Sub-corpus" button** opens a panel with two options:
    1. **Search existing corpuses** — type a name, click Search, results show corpus name/docs/owner. Corpuses that already have a parent show "already nested" and are disabled. Click "+ Add" to nest.
    2. **Create new sub-corpus** — inline form (name + optional description) below an "or create new" divider. Creates the corpus directly as a child of the current corpus via `parentCorpusId` parameter.

- **CorpusListView — Parent Path Display**
  - Nested corpuses in the corpus list now show a small italic "↳ nested in ParentName" label above the corpus name
  - Parent name resolved from the loaded corpuses list via `parent_corpus_id`

- **AppShell — New Prop Threading**
  - `onSelectCorpus` prop passed to `CorpusDetailView` — maps to `setCorpusView({ view: 'detail', corpusId: id })` for sub-corpus navigation

- **api.js — `corpusAPI.create` Updated**
  - Now accepts optional 4th parameter `parentCorpusId` for creating corpuses directly as children (used by the inline create form in CorpusDetailView)

- Files changed: `CorpusDetailView.jsx`, `CorpusListView.jsx`, `AppShell.jsx`, `api.js`

### ✅ Completed (Phase 12e) — Sub-Corpus Expansion in Sidebar (⚠️ Removed in Phase 19a)

**Note:** All sub-corpus expansion infrastructure described below (lazy-load, subCorpusCache, recursive rendering, icon differentiation) was removed in Phase 19a when sub-corpus infrastructure was eliminated.

- **Lazy-load sub-corpuses on expand:** Clicking the ▸ arrow on a subscribed corpus in the sidebar calls `GET /api/corpuses/:id/children` (built in Phase 12a) and renders sub-corpuses indented below the parent
- **New state:** `subCorpusCache` (maps corpus ID → array of `{ id, name, childCount }`) and `loadingCorpusIds` (tracks which nodes are currently fetching)
- **Loading indicator:** Arrow shows "…" while children are being fetched
- **Cache behavior:** Children are fetched once per corpus per session; subsequent expand/collapse is instant. On fetch error, empty array is cached to prevent retry loops.
- **Arrow visibility logic:** Top-level subscribed corpuses always show ▸ initially (collapses to no arrow once loading confirms zero children). Sub-corpuses show ▸ only when `childCount > 0`.
- **Icon differentiation:** Top-level subscribed corpuses use 📚 icon; nested sub-corpuses use 📁 icon
- **Click behavior:** Top-level corpuses activate as corpus tabs (existing behavior). Sub-corpuses open in the corpus detail overlay (since they're not subscribed tabs).
- **Recursive rendering:** Sub-corpuses can themselves be expanded to reveal deeper children, with 16px indentation per depth level
- **Context menu:** Right-click menu only shown on top-level subscribed corpuses (depth 0); sub-corpuses suppress the context menu
- **No backend changes or database migrations needed** — uses existing `GET /api/corpuses/:id/children` endpoint
- **Frontend-only change** — `AppShell.jsx` only
- Files changed: `AppShell.jsx` (new `subCorpusCache` + `loadingCorpusIds` state, updated `toggleCorpusExpand` with lazy loading, new `loadSubCorpuses` helper, rewritten `renderSidebarCorpusItem` with recursive sub-corpus rendering)

### ✅ Completed (Phase 13) — Cross-Annotation Path Linking

A display enhancement for the document annotation sidebar. When a document has multiple annotations from the same concept graph, the path display becomes interactive.

- **Phase 13-1: Clickable Ancestor Annotations**
  - Annotation enrichment now stores `resolvedPathIds` (parallel to `resolvedPathNames`) — an array of concept IDs for each path segment, built from `graph_path` + `parent_id`
  - When viewing an annotation's detail sidebar, each ancestor in the path is checked against all other annotations in the document (comparing ancestor concept ID against each annotation's `child_id`)
  - If a match is found, the ancestor renders as an underlined clickable link using `pathSegmentLinked` style
  - Clicking jumps to that annotation (calls `handleAnnotationClick` which selects it in the sidebar)
  - CorpusTabContent uses warm amber linked style (`#7a6520`); DecontextualizedDocView uses blue tint (`#4a6a8a`) matching their respective highlight themes

- **Phase 13-2: Descendant Path Extension**
  - After rendering the current annotation's leaf concept (bold `pathLeaf`), the code searches for annotations whose `graph_path` contains the current concept's `child_id`
  - For each descendant found, renders the chain from current concept down to the descendant: intermediate concepts (lighter gray `pathSegmentDescendant`) → annotated descendant (underlined `pathSegmentLinked`, clickable)
  - Intermediate concepts that are themselves annotated also get the clickable linked style
  - Multiple descendants show as separate branch lines (each prefixed with →)
  - Branching correctly handles cases where multiple children of the same concept are annotated

- **Frontend-only change:** Cross-references the loaded annotations array to find path overlaps and descendant relationships. No new tables or endpoints needed — all data is already present in the annotation load response (each annotation includes `child_id` with `graph_path`).
- **Scope:** Works in both contextualized (within-corpus) and decontextualized (cross-corpus) document views.
- **New styles:** `pathSegmentLinked` (clickable annotated ancestor/descendant), `pathSegmentDescendant` (intermediate non-annotated concept in descendant chain), `descendantPathRow` (inline container for descendant branch)
- Files changed: `CorpusTabContent.jsx` (resolvedPathIds enrichment, path rendering with clickable ancestors + descendant extension, 3 new styles), `DecontextualizedDocView.jsx` (same changes with blue-tinted linked style)

### Phase 14: Concept Diffing

A dedicated modal for comparing child concept sets across multiple concepts side by side. Users can drill down through levels, comparing how different parts of the ontology organize similar ideas.

### ✅ Completed (Phase 14a) — Basic Diff Modal

- **Entry Point: Right-Click Context Menu on Concept Cards**
  - Right-clicking any concept card in ConceptGrid (Root page or Concept children view) shows a context menu with "Compare children…"
  - ConceptGrid receives new `onCompareChildren` prop; context menu state managed internally with click-away dismissal
  - Both Root.jsx and Concept.jsx pass `handleCompareChildren` handler and render `<DiffModal>`

- **New Backend Endpoint: `POST /api/concepts/batch-children-for-diff`**
  - Accepts `{ panes: [{ conceptId, path }, ...] }` — max 10 panes
  - For each pane, builds `graphPath = [...path, conceptId]` (same convention as `getConceptWithChildren`)
  - Returns children with save counts (dormancy-filtered) plus grandchildren name+attribute strings for Jaccard computation
  - Guest-accessible via `optionalAuth`

- **DiffModal Component (`DiffModal.jsx`)**
  - Full-screen overlay modal with side-by-side pane layout (horizontally scrollable)
  - Each pane shows a concept header (name, attribute, resolved path names) and its children grouped into three sections:
    1. **Shared** (green dot) — children whose name + attribute appears in at least one other pane
    2. **Similar** (amber dot) — children with different names but whose grandchild sets meet the Jaccard threshold. Each similar child shows "≈ OtherName [attr] (X%)" tags
    3. **Unique** (gray dot) — children that are neither shared nor similar
  - When only one pane exists, children are listed without grouping (grouping appears when 2+ panes are present)
  - **Similarity threshold** configurable via dropdown (30%–80%, default 50%)
  - **Grandchild preview** shown on each child card (first 5 grandchildren, italicized)
  - **Search to add panes:** Click "+ Add concept" → search field → select concept → pick a parent context (shows all parent edges + root if applicable) → pane added
  - Path names resolved via `getConceptNames` batch endpoint for both initial concept and added concepts
  - Panes removable via ✕ button (minimum 1 pane)

- **Jaccard Similarity Computation (Frontend)**
  - `jaccardSimilarity(setA, setB)` computes |A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B| on grandchild name+attribute strings
  - `computeGroups(panes, threshold)` classifies each pane's children into shared/similar/unique relative to all other panes
  - Recomputed whenever panes load or threshold changes

- **Styling:** Consistent with Orca's Zen aesthetic — EB Garamond font, off-white (#faf9f6) background, muted green/amber/gray group colors, warm hover states

- **No new database tables.** Reads from existing `edges`, `concepts`, `attributes` tables. Grandchild data fetched server-side for efficiency.

- **Architecture Decision #135 — Batch Endpoint Builds graph_path Internally:** The frontend sends the "context path" (same path value available in Concept.jsx state), and the backend appends `conceptId` to form the actual `graph_path` — matching the same convention used by `getConceptWithChildren`. This avoids requiring the frontend to compute graph paths differently for the diff endpoint.

- **Test Data Script:** `backend/src/config/seed-diff-test-clean.js` creates isolated test hierarchies (ZDiff_ prefixed) with known Shared/Similar/Unique relationships. Run with `--cleanup` flag to remove.

- Files changed: `conceptsController.js` (new `getBatchChildrenForDiff` endpoint), `routes/concepts.js` (new POST route), `api.js` frontend (new `getBatchChildrenForDiff` method), new `DiffModal.jsx`, `ConceptGrid.jsx` (new `onCompareChildren` prop, right-click context menu with state + click-away handler), `Concept.jsx` (DiffModal import, state, handler, prop threading to ConceptGrid, modal rendering), `Root.jsx` (same DiffModal integration pattern)

#### ✅ Completed (Phase 14b) — Drill-Down Navigation

- **Clickable Child Cards:** Every child card in a diff pane is now clickable. Clicking drills into that child — replacing the pane's children with the clicked child's own children, re-grouped into Shared/Similar/Unique relative to all other panes' current levels. A small ▸ arrow on each card indicates drill-down is available. Hover highlights the card.

- **Independent Per-Pane Drill-Down:** Drilling down in one pane does not affect other panes. Each pane tracks its own depth independently. Groups are recomputed across all panes at whatever level each is currently showing (cross-level comparison).

- **Drill Stack & Cached Back-Navigation:** Each pane maintains a `drillStack` array. Drilling pushes the current state (conceptId, name, attribute, path, pathNames, children) onto the stack. Navigating back restores from the stack instantly (no re-fetch needed — children are cached).

- **Breadcrumb Trail Per Pane:** When a pane has been drilled down at least once, a breadcrumb bar appears below the pane header showing the drill-down path. Each ancestor name is clickable (underlined, hover darkens) and navigates back to that level. The current concept name appears bold at the end.

- **Path Construction for Drill-Down:** When drilling from concept C (at path P) into child D, the new path sent to the batch endpoint is `[...P, C]` — the endpoint then builds `graphPath = [...P, C, D]` internally (same convention as Phase 14a, Architecture Decision #135).

- **Child Concept ID Resolution:** The drill-down handler resolves the child's concept ID using a fallback chain: `child.childId || child.conceptId || child.id`. This handles whatever field name the backend returns. A console warning fires if no ID is found.

- **No Backend Changes:** Reuses the existing `POST /api/concepts/batch-children-for-diff` endpoint. Drill-down just calls it with the new concept + updated path.

- **No New Database Tables.**

- **Files changed:** `DiffModal.jsx` only (new `drillStack` state per pane, `handleDrillDown` and `handleBreadcrumbClick` handlers, `ChildCard` receives `onDrillDown` prop, new breadcrumb bar UI, drill arrow indicator on child cards)

#### ✅ Completed (Phase 14c) — Cross-Level Selection

- **Already covered by Phase 14b breadcrumbs.** The original spec envisioned keeping all drill-down levels visible simultaneously and letting users click any visible level to reset a pane. The breadcrumb trail implemented in 14b achieves the same goal more cleanly — clicking any breadcrumb ancestor resets the pane to that level, collapses deeper drill-downs, and triggers group recomputation across all panes at their current levels (mixed-level grouping).

- **Uneven depth alignment skipped.** The original spec called for visual alignment of panes at different depths. In practice, each pane scrolls independently and groups are clearly labeled, so vertical alignment adds complexity without meaningful benefit. Skipped by design.

- **No additional code changes.** Phase 14c functionality is fully covered by the Phase 14b implementation.

### ✅ Completed (Phase 15) — Bug Fixes & Quick Wins

Six fixes addressing regressions, incorrect behavior, and UX improvements.

- **Phase 15a: Sidebar Naming Regression** ✅
  - Sidebar section header "TABS" changed to "GRAPHS"; "GRAPH GROUPS" header added above tab groups section; "+ New tab" button changed to "+ New graph"
  - These labels were correctly defined in Phase 12b (Architecture Decision #42) but regressed in a later session
  - Files changed: `AppShell.jsx`

- **Phase 15b: Sub-Corpus Subscription Bug** ✅
  - Sub-corpuses (corpuses with a non-null `parent_corpus_id`) are no longer independently subscribable
  - Users subscribe to top-level corpuses only; sub-corpuses are accessed by expanding the parent in the sidebar
  - Backend: `listCorpuses` now filters `WHERE parent_corpus_id IS NULL` so only top-level corpuses appear in the browse list
  - Backend: `subscribe` endpoint rejects sub-corpuses with 400 ("Subscribe to the top-level corpus instead")
  - Frontend: Subscribe/Unsubscribe buttons and subscriber count hidden on `CorpusDetailView` when `corpus.parent_corpus_id` is set
  - Files changed: `corpusController.js`, `CorpusDetailView.jsx`

- **Phase 15c: Sub-Corpus Document Opening Bug** ✅
  - No longer applicable as a separate fix — sub-corpuses cannot be subscribed to, so no separate corpus tab is created for them. Documents in sub-corpuses are accessed through the parent corpus's tab context via sidebar expansion.

- **Phase 15d: Duplicate Concept in Parent Path Display** ✅
  - **Root cause:** `graph_path` stores the path from root to parent *inclusive of the parent at the end*. Multiple components were resolving all IDs in `graph_path` to names AND then appending `parentName` separately, causing the parent to appear twice (e.g., "Health → Fitness → Fitness → Cardio [action]").
  - **Fix:** Removed the separate `parentName` append in enrichment code since `graph_path` already includes it. In components where the parent is displayed separately (MoveModal), path names are resolved from `graph_path.slice(0, -1)` (all but the last element).
  - **Affected files:** `CorpusTabContent.jsx` (annotation sidebar path enrichment), `AnnotationPanel.jsx` (context picker path enrichment), `MoveModal.jsx` (MoveDestinationCard + ContextCard path resolution)
  - **Not affected:** `FlipView.jsx` (already correctly used `graph_path.slice(0, -1)` for path display above parent)
  - **Learning:** When resolving `graph_path` to display names, remember that `graph_path` includes the parent as the last element. Never append the parent again. The leaf concept (the child of the edge) is the only thing appended after the resolved path.

- **Phase 15e: Show Destination Concept in Move Vote Path** ✅
  - The MoveModal `ContextCard` now shows the full destination: `ParentName → SelectedConcept [attr]` instead of just `ParentName [attr]`
  - `ContextCard` accepts new `selectedConceptName` prop, displays parent in lighter color with the selected concept (the actual destination) in bold
  - For root contexts, only the concept name is shown (no parent above it) with a "root" badge
  - Files changed: `MoveModal.jsx`

- **Phase 15f: Root Concept as Pickable Card in Move Destination** ✅
  - When searching for a move destination, `handleSearchResultClick` now also checks for root edges (same pattern as AnnotationPanel) and includes them in the context options
  - Root concepts appear as normal clickable context cards with a "root" badge, consistent with non-root context cards
  - Removed the special-case "No parent contexts found. This concept is only a root." message and separate "Browse from here →" button
  - Clicking a root context card opens the mini graph browser from root (same end result, consistent UX)
  - Files changed: `MoveModal.jsx`

- **Files changed (across all Phase 15 sub-phases):** `AppShell.jsx` (sidebar labels, GRAPH GROUPS header), `corpusController.js` (listCorpuses WHERE filter, subscribe rejection), `CorpusDetailView.jsx` (hide subscribe/unsubscribe/subscriber count on sub-corpuses), `CorpusTabContent.jsx` (annotation path enrichment fix), `AnnotationPanel.jsx` (context picker path enrichment fix), `MoveModal.jsx` (path resolution fixes, selectedConceptName on ContextCard, root edge lookup, root badge style)
- **No database migrations required** — all changes are backend logic + frontend display

---

### ✅ Completed: Phase 16 — Moderation / Spam Flagging

A basic moderation mechanism for hiding spam/vandalism. Designed for manual admin oversight initially, with community voting infrastructure for future scaling.

- **Phase 16a: Backend Infrastructure** ✅
  - New `concept_flags` table, `concept_flag_votes` table, `moderation_comments` table, and `is_hidden` column on `edges` (see schema above)
  - New `moderationController.js` with 7 endpoints under `/api/moderation`: flag, getHiddenChildren, voteOnHidden, removeVoteOnHidden, addComment, getComments, unhideEdge
  - New `routes/moderation.js` route file registered in `server.js`
  - Admin user determined by `ADMIN_USER_ID` environment variable in `.env` (not hardcoded)
  - `getHiddenChildren` returns `isAdmin` boolean so frontend can conditionally show the Unhide button
  - Frontend `moderationAPI` methods added to `api.js`
  - Files changed: `migrate.js`, `server.js`, `api.js`; new files: `moderationController.js`, `moderation.js` (routes)

- **Phase 16b: Hide/Show Mechanics** ✅
  - 13 queries across `conceptsController.js` updated with `AND e.is_hidden = false` or `AND ... .is_hidden = false` on JOIN conditions:
    - `getRootConcepts`: root edge join + child count join filter hidden; root-detection subquery intentionally NOT filtered (a concept that's a child somewhere, even hidden, shouldn't appear as a root)
    - `getConceptWithChildren`: children query + child_count (grandchild edges) both filter hidden
    - `getConceptParents`: both contextual and exploratory queries + both Jaccard similarity queries filter hidden
    - `searchConcepts`: child-check query filters hidden (so hidden children don't show "already exists")
    - `getVoteSets`: vote set computation excludes hidden edges
    - `getBatchChildrenForDiff`: children + grandchildren queries both filter hidden
  - Hidden namespace blocking in `createChildConcept`: if an edge exists with same name+attribute+path but is hidden, returns 409 "This concept exists but has been hidden by the community"
  - Write protection: `addVote` (400 "Cannot save a hidden concept"), `addWebLink` (400 "Cannot add web links to a hidden concept"), `createAnnotation` (400 "Cannot annotate with a hidden concept")
  - Files changed: `conceptsController.js`, `votesController.js`, `corpusController.js`

- **Phase 16c: Hidden Concepts UI** ✅
  - New `HiddenConceptsView.jsx` component — modal overlay accessed via "🚫 N hidden" badge in concept/root header
  - Shows hidden concepts with: name + attribute, flag count badge, creator username, hide/show vote buttons (toggle), expandable comment threads with add-comment form, admin-only "↩ Unhide" button
  - "🚫 N hidden" badge appears in `Concept.jsx` concept header and `Root.jsx` top bar when hidden count > 0 and user is logged in
  - Right-click context menu on concept cards in `ConceptGrid.jsx` now includes "🚩 Flag as spam" option (red, with confirmation dialog)
  - Flagging immediately hides the concept and refreshes the page + hidden count
  - Closing the hidden panel refreshes both the hidden count and the concept/root list (so unhidden concepts reappear)
  - Files changed: `Concept.jsx`, `Root.jsx`, `ConceptGrid.jsx`; new file: `HiddenConceptsView.jsx`

---

### ✅ Completed: Phase 17 — Document Types / Tags

User-generated tags for documents to categorize research material (preprint, outline, grant application, protocol, review, etc.).

- **Phase 17a: Backend Infrastructure** ✅
  - New `document_tags` table: `id`, `name` (VARCHAR(100), UNIQUE case-insensitive), `created_by` (FK to users), `created_at`
  - New `document_tag_links` table: `id`, `document_id` (FK to documents), `tag_id` (FK to document_tags), `added_by` (FK to users), `created_at`. `UNIQUE(document_id, tag_id)`.
  - New `routes/documents.js` route file — consolidates the old standalone `GET /api/documents/:id` route (previously inline in `server.js`) with the new tag endpoints
  - `server.js` updated: old standalone document route removed, new `documentRoutes` mounted at `/api/documents`
  - New endpoints:
    - `GET /api/documents/tags` — list all tags (with usage counts). Guest-accessible.
    - `POST /api/documents/tags/create` — create a new tag. Auth required. Case-insensitive uniqueness check; returns 409 with existing tag if duplicate.
    - `POST /api/documents/tags/assign` — assign a tag to a document. Auth required. Body: `{ documentId, tagId }`. Returns 409 if already assigned.
    - `POST /api/documents/tags/remove` — remove a tag from a document. Auth required (link creator or owner of any corpus the document belongs to). Body: `{ documentId, tagId }`.
    - `GET /api/documents/:id/tags` — get tags for a specific document. Guest-accessible.
  - Frontend API methods added to `documentsAPI`: `listTags`, `createTag`, `assignTag`, `removeTag`, `getDocumentTags`
  - `getCorpus` endpoint updated: now returns a `tags` array (via `json_agg` subquery) on each document in the corpus response
  - `getAnnotationsForEdge` endpoint updated: now fetches and attaches tags to each document in the annotation response (for WebLinksView display)
  - Files changed: `migrate.js` (2 new tables + indexes), `corpusController.js` (5 new tag endpoints + updated `getCorpus` and `getAnnotationsForEdge`), new `routes/documents.js`, `server.js` (route consolidation), `api.js` frontend (extended `documentsAPI`)

- **Phase 17b: Frontend — Tag UI** ✅
  - **Upload form tag picker** (`CorpusTabContent.jsx`): optional tag picker between the format selector and body textarea. Search existing tags or type a new name and press Enter to create. Selected tags display as blue pills with ✕ to remove. Tags are assigned to the document after successful upload.
  - **Tag pills on document cards** (`CorpusTabContent.jsx`): each document card shows its tags as small blue pills below the metadata line. Logged-in users see ✕ on each pill to remove tags.
  - **🏷 add tag button** on each document card: opens an inline dropdown to search/create tags and assign them to existing documents. Visible to all logged-in users.
  - **Filter by tag** (`CorpusTabContent.jsx`): a tag filter bar appears above the document list when any documents have tags. Click a tag pill to filter the list to only matching documents; click again to deselect. "Clear" link resets the filter.
  - **External Links page** (`WebLinksView.jsx`): document entries in the Document Annotations section now show tag pills (read-only) below each document title.
  - Note: "Sort by tag" grouping was planned but deferred — the filter-by-tag approach provides the core functionality. Can be added later if needed.
  - Files changed: `CorpusTabContent.jsx` (tag state, tag handlers, upload tag picker, doc card tag pills, filter bar, inline tag add menu, new styles), `WebLinksView.jsx` (tag pills on document annotation entries, new styles)

- **Phase 17 Bug Fixes** (6 bugs fixed post-implementation, via Claude Code)
  - ✅ **Bug: Subscribed corpus tabs disappear from sidebar.** `handleOpenConceptTab` auto-groups corpus tabs with concept tabs it spawns (sets `group_id` on corpus subscription). `ungroupedCorpusTabs` filtered these out, and `renderSidebarGroup` only rendered `graphTabs` inside groups — never corpus tabs. Additionally, `renderSidebarCorpusItem` used `depth === 0` as proxy for "is subscribed corpus", which broke at `depth=1` inside a group. Fix: `renderSidebarGroup` now renders both corpus and graph tabs within groups. Replaced `depth === 0` checks with `corpusTabs.some(t => t.id === tab.id)` to use the actual subscription list as source of truth. Added `setCorpusView(null)` and `setSavedPageOpen(false)` to the corpus tab click handler. (`AppShell.jsx`)
  - ✅ **Bug: "Subscribe to top-level corpus" error when opening sub-corpus documents.** `onOpenDocument` from `CorpusDetailView` called `handleSubscribeToCorpus` with the sub-corpus ID. Backend correctly rejects subscribe for sub-corpuses. Fix: `CorpusDetailView` now passes `parent_corpus_id` in `onOpenDocument`. AppShell's handler walks up the parent chain via `getCorpus` to find the top-level corpus, with a short-circuit check against `corpusTabs` (known subscriptions) to avoid unnecessary API calls. Error fallback returns early instead of falling through to subscribe. (`AppShell.jsx`, `CorpusDetailView.jsx`)
  - ✅ **Bug: Graph tab click does nothing while corpus browse overlay is open.** `renderSidebarGraphItem` onClick only called `setActiveTab` but never cleared `corpusView`. The corpus overlay renders when `corpusView !== null`, blocking graph tab content. Fix: added `setCorpusView(null)` and `setSavedPageOpen(false)` to graph tab click handler. (`AppShell.jsx`)
  - ✅ **Bug: CorpusDetailView missing version/draft info.** Document cards in the Corpuses browse page had a simpler template than `CorpusTabContent` — no version badge, no draft badge, no dashed border for drafts. Fix: added `docTitleRow` wrapper, version badge, draft badge, and `docCardDraft` border style to match `CorpusTabContent`. (`CorpusDetailView.jsx`)
  - ✅ **Bug: CorpusDetailView missing tag pills on document cards.** Backend `getCorpus` returned tags via `json_agg` subquery, but `CorpusDetailView` never rendered them. Fix: added tag pill display matching `CorpusTabContent`'s style. (`CorpusDetailView.jsx`)
  - ✅ **Bug: No tag filtering in WebLinksView Document Annotations.** Tags displayed as read-only pills but couldn't filter. Fix: added `annotationTagFilter` state, a "Filter by tag" bar above the corpus list, and filtering logic that hides non-matching documents and entire corpuses with no matching documents. (`WebLinksView.jsx`)
  - Files changed across all bug fixes: `AppShell.jsx` (graph tab click handler, corpus tab click handler, grouped corpus tab rendering, `groupContainsActiveTab`, sub-corpus document open walk-up), `CorpusDetailView.jsx` (version/draft badges, tag pills, `onOpenDocument` passes `parent_corpus_id`), `WebLinksView.jsx` (tag filter bar, tag pill rendering, tag filter styles)

---

### ✅ Completed: Phase 18 — Flip View Shared Path Highlighting

A hover-based highlighting feature for Flip View cards. When a user hovers over a concept name in any card's path, the longest contiguous shared path segment containing that concept is highlighted across all other visible cards that share it.

- **Frontend-only change** — no backend modifications or new tables needed
- **Hover model (revised from original click-based spec):** The original design called for click-based selection with Ctrl+click for multi-segment support. This was revised to hover-based because the entire Flip View card is clickable for navigation — click-based path selection would conflict with card navigation. Hover is zero-commitment, instantly discoverable, and requires no mode switching.
- **Single concept hover:** Hovering a concept name in any card's path identifies that concept ID. Every other card containing the same concept ID in its `graph_path` highlights that concept name with warm amber background (`rgba(232, 217, 160, 0.5)`).
- **Contiguous shared segment extension:** The highlight isn't limited to the single hovered concept — it extends to the longest contiguous shared subsequence between the hovered card's path and each other card's path that includes the hovered concept. E.g., if Card A has path [Research, Methods, Analysis] and Card C has [Biology, Research, Methods, Analysis], hovering "Methods" on Card A highlights the full "Research → Methods → Analysis" segment on both cards.
- **Multiple simultaneous matches:** A single hover may match different segments on different cards. All matches highlight simultaneously.
- **Algorithm:** `getSharedSegments(pathA, pathB)` finds all maximal contiguous runs of concept IDs that appear identically (same values, same order, adjacent) in both arrays. `computeHighlightMap()` builds a per-card `Set<conceptId>` of IDs to highlight based on current hover state, running shared segment detection against all other cards.
- **Path rendering refactored:** The old `getPathAboveParent()` (which returned a plain string) is replaced by `renderAncestorPath()` which renders each ancestor concept as its own `<span>` with `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave`. The parent name (last element of `graph_path`) also participates in hover highlighting.
- **No interference with card clicks:** Hover spans do not use `stopPropagation` or `preventDefault`. Card `onClick` navigation continues to work unchanged.
- **Preserves vote-based card ordering** — highlighting is purely visual overlay, does not reorder cards
- **Test data:** `seed-flip-test.js` creates ZFlip_ prefixed concepts with 7 overlapping paths to exercise single-concept matches, 2-segment shared segments, and 3-segment shared segments. Run with `--cleanup` to remove.
- Files changed: `FlipView.jsx`

### ✅ Completed: Phase 19 — Sidebar Redesign & Sub-Corpus Removal

**Goal:** Removed sub-corpus infrastructure entirely. Redesigned the sidebar into a single unified list where corpuses, groups, and loose graph tabs coexist freely with no section headers. Users can drag and drop graph tabs into/out of groups, reorder everything, and organize their workspace however they want.

**Philosophy:** Prioritize graphs over folder structures. The sidebar is a workspace for organizing graph exploration, not a document filing system. Corpuses remain important (they hold documents and annotations) but in the sidebar they function as containers for related graph tabs, sitting alongside groups and loose tabs as equals.

- **Phase 19a: Sub-Corpus Removal (Backend + Frontend Cleanup) ✅**
  - **Backend:**
    - Migration: `ALTER TABLE corpuses DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS parent_corpus_id` + `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_corpuses_parent`
    - `corpusController.js`: Removed `parentCorpusId` param from `createCorpus`, `parent_corpus_id` from `listCorpuses` SELECT and its `WHERE parent_corpus_id IS NULL` filter, `parent_corpus_id` from `getCorpus` SELECT, entire `childCorpuses` subquery + response field, `parent_corpus_id` check in `subscribe`, and entire `isAncestor` / `addSubcorpus` / `removeSubcorpus` / `getCorpusChildren` / `getCorpusTree` functions + exports
    - `corpuses.js`: Removed 4 routes: `GET /:id/children`, `GET /:id/tree`, `POST /:parentId/add-subcorpus`, `POST /:parentId/remove-subcorpus`
  - **Frontend:**
    - `api.js`: Removed `addSubcorpus`, `removeSubcorpus`, `getCorpusChildren`, `getCorpusTree` from `corpusAPI`
    - `AppShell.jsx`: Removed `expandedCorpusIds`, `subCorpusCache`, `loadingCorpusIds` state; `toggleCorpusExpand`, `loadSubCorpuses` functions; simplified `renderSidebarCorpusItem` to flat rendering without expand arrows; removed parent-walk-up logic from `onOpenDocument`
    - `CorpusDetailView.jsx`: Removed all sub-corpus state, search/add/remove/create handlers, entire Sub-corpuses JSX section, `parent_corpus_id` conditionals on subscriber count and subscribe/unsubscribe buttons
    - `CorpusListView.jsx`: Removed "↳ nested in…" parentPath display
  - **Non-destructive:** Existing sub-corpuses became top-level corpuses — no data deleted
  - Files changed: `migrate.js`, `corpusController.js`, `corpuses.js`, `api.js`, `AppShell.jsx`, `CorpusDetailView.jsx`, `CorpusListView.jsx`

- **Phase 19b: Unified Sidebar Layout (Remove Section Headers) ✅**
  - Merged three sidebar sections (CORPUSES / GRAPH GROUPS / GRAPHS) into one unlabeled scrollable list
  - **New `sidebar_items` table** with unified ordering: `user_id`, `item_type` ('corpus'|'group'|'graph_tab'), `item_id`, `display_order`. `UNIQUE(user_id, item_type, item_id)`.
  - **Backend:**
    - `corpusController.js`: `subscribe` now inserts into `sidebar_items` (at MAX+10 order); `unsubscribe` deletes from `sidebar_items`
    - `votes.js`: Added `GET /sidebar-items` and `POST /sidebar-items/reorder` routes
  - **Frontend:**
    - `api.js`: Added `votesAPI.getSidebarItems()` and `votesAPI.reorderSidebarItems(items)`
    - `AppShell.jsx`: Added `sidebarItems` state; `loadAllTabs` fetches `getSidebarItems()` as 4th parallel call; added `refreshSidebarItems()` helper; all mutation handlers (create/close graph tab, duplicate, open concept tab, subscribe/unsubscribe corpus, create/delete group) call `refreshSidebarItems()` after success; sidebar rendering replaced 3 labeled sections with single unified `sidebarItems.map(...)` loop; guest mode unchanged
  - **Bug fix:** `getSidebarItems` failure in `Promise.all` was taking down the entire `loadAllTabs` call, preventing corpus tabs from loading (user appeared unsubscribed). Fixed by wrapping `getSidebarItems` in `.catch(() => ...)` fallback. Also fixed: on 409 in subscribe (already subscribed), now refreshes corpus list from server.
  - Files changed: `migrate.js`, `corpusController.js`, `votes.js`, `votesController.js`, `api.js`, `AppShell.jsx`

- **Phase 19c: Drag-and-Drop with @dnd-kit ✅**
  - **New dependency:** `@dnd-kit/core`, `@dnd-kit/sortable`, `@dnd-kit/utilities` in frontend `package.json`
  - **New file: `SidebarDndContext.jsx`** — three exported components sharing one `DndContext`:
    - `SidebarDndContext` (default) — wraps sidebar tree with `DndContext` + top-level `SortableContext`. Uses `PointerSensor` with 8px activation distance so normal clicks never accidentally start a drag. Renders a `DragOverlay` ghost during drag.
    - `SortableGroupWrapper` — uses `setActivatorNodeRef` to restrict drag activation to group header only, so grabbing a tab inside an expanded group doesn't pick up the whole group.
    - `GroupMemberContext` — inner `SortableContext` placed inside each expanded group, allowing member tabs to be independently draggable.
    - `SortableItem` — lightweight `useSortable` wrapper, fades to 35% opacity while dragging.
  - **AppShell.jsx changes:**
    - New state: `activeDragId`, `overGroupItemId`
    - Computed: `topLevelSidebarItems`, `topLevelSortableIds`, `activeDragOverlay` (ghost label)
    - Three drag handlers:
      - `handleDragStart` — sets `activeDragId`
      - `handleDragOver` — sets `overGroupItemId` when graph tab hovers over group header
      - `handleDragEnd` — three cases: (a) graph tab dropped on group → `addTabToGroup` + optimistic update; (b) grouped tab dropped on non-group → `removeTabFromGroup`, becomes loose; (c) top-level reorder → `arrayMove` + `reorderSidebarItems` API call. All with rollback on failure.
    - Sidebar tree wrapped in `<SidebarDndContext>` with each top-level item in `<SortableItem>`
    - Groups wrapped in `<SortableGroupWrapper>` with expanded members in `<GroupMemberContext>` + per-member `<SortableItem>`
    - Context menu: "Add to group / Create group with this tab" kept alongside drag support. "Remove from group" kept.
    - New styles: `sidebarDropTarget` (warm amber `rgba(232,217,160,0.5)` highlight on valid drop target), `dragOverlay` (ghost card)
  - Files changed: `AppShell.jsx`, new `SidebarDndContext.jsx`, `package.json`, `api.js`

- **Phase 19d: Cleanup & Migration Safety ✅**
  - `migrate.js`: `ALTER TABLE corpus_subscriptions DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS group_id` — column was cleared to NULL in Phase 12, now fully removed
  - `votesController.js`: `addTabToGroup` and `removeTabFromGroup` now return 400 for `tabType === 'corpus'` instead of trying to write the dropped column
  - `corpusController.js`: Removed `cs.group_id` from `getMySubscriptions` SELECT
  - `AppShell.jsx`:
    - `loadAllTabs`: corpus tabs now load with `group_id: null` (removed stale `sub.group_id` reference)
    - Removed auto-grouping block from `handleOpenConceptTab` — opening a concept from a corpus no longer silently creates a group (was always creating a fresh group since `corpusTab.group_id` was always null after column drop)
    - `renderSidebarGroup`: removed `memberCorpus` — corpus tabs can't be group members anymore
    - `handleDeleteGroup`: removed corpus tab ungroup step
    - Removed dead `sidebarSectionHeader` style (leftover from old 3-section sidebar)
  - Files changed: `migrate.js`, `votesController.js`, `corpusController.js`, `AppShell.jsx`

- **Architecture Decision #152 — Unified Sidebar with @dnd-kit:** The sidebar is redesigned from three labeled sections (CORPUSES / GRAPH GROUPS / GRAPHS) to a single unlabeled list. Corpuses, groups, and loose graph tabs are peers — all freely reorderable via drag-and-drop. A `sidebar_items` table provides unified ordering. `@dnd-kit` chosen for its sortable + nestable container pattern, which matches the sidebar's drag semantics precisely. Sub-corpus infrastructure (Phase 12a/d/e) removed entirely — document organization is handled by corpuses as flat containers. `corpus_subscriptions.group_id` removed — corpus tabs no longer participate in flat tab groups.
- **Architecture Decision #153 — Promise.all Fault Tolerance for Sidebar Loading:** When `loadAllTabs` uses `Promise.all` to fetch corpus tabs, graph tabs, groups, and sidebar items in parallel, a failure in any one member (e.g., `getSidebarItems` returning 500 before migration runs) rejects the entire batch, causing the app to think the user has no subscriptions. Fixed by wrapping non-critical calls in `.catch()` fallbacks with empty-array defaults. Rule: any newly added `Promise.all` member in `loadAllTabs` must have a `.catch()` fallback so existing data still loads.

### ✅ Completed: Phase 20 — Graph & Vote Simplification

Fundamental simplification of the data model and vote system: enforce single-attribute-per-graph, remove move votes, make saves and swaps mutually exclusive, and expand annotation context in external links.

**Philosophy:** Reduce conceptual overhead for users. A graph is one attribute — you pick it at root creation and everything inherits it. Move votes are redundant with Flip View link votes. Saves and swaps represent opposing stances on a concept's placement, so they shouldn't coexist.

- **Phase 20a: Single-Attribute Graphs**
  - **Core change:** Every graph has exactly one attribute, determined by the root edge's `attribute_id`. All descendant edges must have the same attribute.
  - **Storage model (Architecture Decision #151):** `attribute_id` remains on every edge (not just root edges) for query simplicity — avoids adding root-edge joins to every read query. Consistency is enforced on write: when adding a child, backend looks up the root edge's attribute (via `graph_path[0]`) and sets the new edge's `attribute_id` to match. Users no longer select an attribute when adding non-root concepts.
  - **Root concept creation:** User selects an attribute when creating a root concept (existing behavior). This attribute applies to the entire graph.
  - **Adding children:** Attribute selection UI removed from child-add flow. Backend auto-assigns the graph's attribute.
  - **UI changes — attribute display removal:**
    - Remove `[attribute]` square bracket tags from concept names everywhere: child lists, search results, flip view cards, breadcrumbs, Saved page, diff modal, annotation cards
    - Add attribute display in the **concept page header** — prominent placement near the breadcrumb path (e.g., "action" displayed as a styled label)
    - Add attribute display in the **root page** — each root concept card shows its attribute
    - Add attribute display in **annotation cards** — the annotation's concept path includes the graph attribute somewhere visible, but not as a bracket tag after every concept name
    - Flip View cards: remove attribute brackets from path display. The attribute can be shown once per card or in a header since all contexts for the same concept may span different-attribute graphs.
  - **Search results:** Remove `[attribute]` from search result display. Since the same concept can appear in graphs of different attributes, search results link to the decontextualized Flip View (existing behavior) where the user sees all contexts — the attribute is visible per-context, not per-concept.
  - **Migration:** For each graph (identified by root concept): count edges per attribute, pick the most common, UPDATE all edges in the graph to use the winning attribute. Run as a migration script.
  - **UNIQUE constraint on edges:** Remains `(parent_id, child_id, graph_path, attribute_id)`. Since all edges in a graph share the same attribute, this is effectively `(parent_id, child_id, graph_path)` — but keeping `attribute_id` in the constraint is harmless and avoids a constraint migration.
  - Files expected to change: `migrate.js` (migration script), `conceptsController.js` (enforce attribute on child creation, remove attribute selection from add-child), `SearchField.jsx` / `AddConceptModal.jsx` (remove attribute picker from child-add flow), `ConceptGrid.jsx` (remove bracket tags), `Concept.jsx` (add attribute to header), `Root.jsx` (show attribute on root cards), `FlipView.jsx` (remove bracket tags), `SavedPageOverlay.jsx` / `SavedTabContent.jsx` (remove bracket tags), `DiffModal.jsx` (remove bracket tags), `CorpusTabContent.jsx` (annotation card attribute display), `DecontextualizedDocView.jsx` (same), `WebLinksView.jsx` (same)

- **Phase 20b: Remove Move Votes**
  - **Rationale:** Move votes ("this concept belongs in a different context") are functionally redundant with Flip View link votes ("this other context is relevant/better"). A user who thinks a concept should be moved can click into the concept, open Flip View, and link-vote the destination context. The signal is the same.
  - **Drop `side_votes` table** (migration)
  - **Remove all move vote endpoints:** `GET /move/:edgeId`, `POST /move/add`, `POST /move/remove`
  - **Remove `move_count`** from children queries in `conceptsController.js` (`getConceptWithChildren`, `getRootConcepts`)
  - **Remove MoveModal.jsx** entirely
  - **Remove move vote UI** from `ConceptGrid.jsx` (→ N indicator), `Concept.jsx` (move button), `SavedPageOverlay.jsx` / `SavedTabContent.jsx` (→ N indicator on saved trees)
  - **Remove move vote references** from `api.js` frontend
  - Files expected to change: `migrate.js`, `votesController.js`, `votes.js`, `conceptsController.js`, `api.js`, `ConceptGrid.jsx`, `Concept.jsx`, `SavedPageOverlay.jsx`, `SavedTabContent.jsx`, delete `MoveModal.jsx`

- **Phase 20c: Save/Swap Mutual Exclusivity**
  - **Rule:** A user can either save an edge OR swap-vote it, but not both. Saving an edge automatically removes any existing swap vote by that user on that edge. Swap-voting an edge automatically removes any existing save by that user on that edge.
  - **Backend enforcement:**
    - `addVote` (save): before inserting the vote, DELETE any `replace_votes` row where `user_id` matches and `edge_id` matches. (Note: a swap vote has `edge_id` = the edge being replaced, so we match on that.)
    - `addSwapVote`: before inserting the swap vote, DELETE any `votes` row where `user_id` and `edge_id` match. Also trigger cascading unsave logic (since removing a save may cascade to descendants).
  - **Frontend:** When a user saves, the swap indicator on that concept updates immediately (swap removed). When a user swaps, the save indicator updates (save removed). No confirmation dialog — automatic.
  - **No migration needed:** Existing data where users have both a save and swap on the same edge can be left as-is (grandfathered) or cleaned up. Since it's test data, a cleanup script that removes the save when both exist is simplest.
  - Files expected to change: `votesController.js` (addVote, addSwapVote), `api.js` (response handling), `ConceptGrid.jsx` (UI updates after save/swap), `Concept.jsx` (same)

- **Phase 20d: Annotation Sentence Expansion in External Links**
  - When annotations are displayed in `WebLinksView.jsx` (External Links page), currently only the annotated text selection is shown
  - **Change:** Expand the displayed text to show the **full sentence** containing the annotation, with the annotated portion **bolded** within it
  - **Sentence detection:** From the annotation's `start_position`, scan backward to the nearest sentence boundary (`.` `?` `!` or start of document). From `end_position`, scan forward to the nearest sentence boundary (or end of document). Extract that range from the document body.
  - **Rendering:** The full sentence is displayed, with the annotated substring wrapped in `<strong>` (or bold styling) so it stands out
  - **Backend change:** The existing annotation response already includes `start_position`, `end_position`, and the document `body` is available. Sentence expansion can be computed either backend (new field in response) or frontend (from the loaded document body). Frontend is simpler since the body is already loaded for display.
  - **Applies to:** `WebLinksView.jsx` and `DecontextualizedDocView.jsx` (anywhere annotations are shown outside the document reader)
  - Files expected to change: `WebLinksView.jsx`, possibly `DecontextualizedDocView.jsx`

- **Architecture Decision #151 — Single-Attribute Graphs with Redundant Edge Storage:** Graphs are now single-attribute: the root edge's `attribute_id` determines the graph's attribute, and all descendant edges must match. Rather than storing the attribute only on the root edge (which would require root-edge joins on every read query), `attribute_id` is kept on every edge for query simplicity. Consistency is enforced at write time. This means the `attribute_id` column on non-root edges is technically redundant but avoids rewriting the entire query layer. The UNIQUE constraint on edges retains `attribute_id` to avoid a constraint migration.

- **Architecture Decision #152 — Move Votes Removed as Redundant with Flip View Links:** Move votes ("this concept belongs elsewhere") and Flip View link votes ("this other context is relevant") express the same signal — that a different parent context is important. Move votes required a destination-picking modal and complex UI; link votes achieve the same thing with a single click in Flip View. Removing move votes simplifies the vote system from four types to three (save, swap, link) and removes a significant chunk of UI complexity (MoveModal, destination search, mini graph browser).

- **Architecture Decision #153 — Save/Swap Mutual Exclusivity:** Saving endorses a concept's placement; swapping asserts it should be replaced. These are contradictory stances on the same edge. Making them mutually exclusive (saving removes swaps, swapping removes saves) ensures vote signals are clean. The automatic removal (no confirmation dialog) keeps interaction fast — users can always re-vote if they change their mind.

### ✅ Completed: Phase 21 — Document Experience Overhaul

Consolidates several document UX improvements: always-editable documents with annotation-safe diff-and-rebase, "My Documents" section in corpus views, version consolidation on document cards, and editor cleanup.

**Philosophy:** Documents should be living artifacts, not frozen snapshots. Users should be able to edit their documents at any time without losing community annotations. The annotation system adapts to text changes rather than requiring immutability.

- **Phase 21a: Always-Editable Documents with Diff-and-Rebase** ✅ ⚠️ PARTIALLY REVERSED BY PHASE 22a
  - **Note:** The edit endpoint, `adjustAnnotationOffsets` helper, and `diff-match-patch` dependency introduced in this phase are removed in Phase 22a (file-upload-only pivot). The `is_draft` removal and migration from this phase remain in effect. The always-editable concept is replaced by version uploads.
  - **New dependency:** `diff-match-patch` (~8KB, Google's open-source diff library) installed in backend — **REMOVED in Phase 22a**
  - **Core change:** Documents are always editable by their original uploader. There is no finalization step. The `is_draft` column and all draft/finalize logic are removed.
  - **Migration:** Finalizes any remaining drafts (`UPDATE documents SET is_draft = false WHERE is_draft = true`), then drops `is_draft` column. Phase 20a migration made idempotent to survive re-runs.
  - **Annotation offset adjustment:** When a document is saved after editing, the backend computes a diff between old and new text using `diff-match-patch`. All annotations on the document (across all corpuses) have their `start_position` and `end_position` adjusted based on the diff. Annotations whose anchored text was partially or fully deleted are removed.
  - **New backend helper:** `adjustAnnotationOffsets(oldText, newText, documentId)` — computes diff, maps positions to new offsets, adjusts shifted annotations, deletes invalidated annotations, returns count of adjusted and deleted annotations
  - **New endpoint:** `POST /api/corpuses/documents/:id/edit` — accepts `{ body }`. Only the original uploader (`uploaded_by`) can edit. Calls `adjustAnnotationOffsets`, updates document body, invalidates `document_concept_links_cache`. Returns `{ success, adjusted, deleted }`.
  - **Concept link cache:** Invalidated (DELETE rows) whenever a document is edited. Recomputed on next view. Draft-check logic removed from cache endpoint.
  - **Removed:** `updateDraft` and `finalizeDraft` endpoints and their routes. All `is_draft` references removed from active queries. `createVersion` now creates regular (non-draft) documents.
  - **Frontend:** Added `corpusAPI.editDocument(documentId, body)`. Removed `updateDraft`/`finalizeDraft` API methods. CorpusTabContent: replaced draft state (`docEditing`/`editBody`/`savingEdit`) with Edit button shown only to original uploader; edit panel with Save/Cancel; after save reloads annotations and concept links; removed draft badges, dashed borders, finalize button, concept links preview panel below editor, read-only document copy below editor. CorpusDetailView: removed draft badges and dashed borders.
  - **Naming fix:** Document body edit handlers named `handleStartDocEdit`/`handleSaveDocEdit` to avoid conflicting with existing corpus name/description edit handlers (`handleStartEdit`).
  - Files changed: `migrate.js`, `corpusController.js`, `corpuses.js` routes, `api.js`, `CorpusTabContent.jsx`, `CorpusDetailView.jsx`

- **Phase 21b: My Documents Section in Corpus View** ✅
  - When a logged-in user views any corpus, a collapsible "My Documents" section appears at the top of the document list showing all documents where `uploaded_by` matches the current user
  - Section always visible for logged-in users, even when empty (shows subtle italic hint)
  - Documents in "My Documents" also appear in their normal position in the full list below (convenience duplicate)
  - **Collapsible:** `myDocsCollapsed` state (default expanded). Header has ▾/▸ toggle arrow.
  - **"All Documents" header** added above the main document list for visual separation
  - **Tag filter applied:** My Documents section respects the active document tag filter (bug fixed post-implementation)
  - Full doc card interactivity in CorpusTabContent (favorites, tags, tag menu, remove button). Simpler cards in CorpusDetailView.
  - **Guest users:** Section not shown
  - **Backend:** No new endpoints — `uploaded_by` already in the `getCorpus` SELECT query
  - Files changed: `CorpusTabContent.jsx`, `CorpusDetailView.jsx`

- **Phase 21c: Version Consolidation on Document Cards** ✅
  - Documents in a version chain (sharing `source_document_id` lineage) are consolidated into a single card showing the latest version's title with a "vN" badge
  - **New backend endpoint:** `GET /api/documents/:id/version-chain` — lightweight recursive CTE (same logic as `getVersionHistory` but no body text or username join). Returns `id, title, version_number, uploaded_by, created_at` ordered by `version_number`. Guest-accessible.
  - **Frontend grouping:** `groupDocsByLineage(docs)` helper walks `source_document_id` chains, groups by root, returns only the latest version per chain with `_chainLength`. Applied to both "All Documents" and "My Documents" lists.
  - **Version navigator in document view:** When `versionChain.length > 1`, shows `← v1 | v2 | [v3] →` bar at top. Current version highlighted. Clicking ←/→ arrows or version pills loads adjacent version via `handleOpenVersion`.
  - **`getAnnotationsForEdge` updated:** Now returns `document_version_number` per document in the annotations response, used by WebLinksView to show version badges.
  - **WebLinksView:** Version badge ("vN") shown next to document title in Document Annotations section when `documentVersionNumber > 1`.
  - Files changed: `corpusController.js`, `routes/documents.js`, `api.js`, `CorpusTabContent.jsx`, `CorpusDetailView.jsx`, `WebLinksView.jsx`

- **Architecture Decision #154 — Diff-and-Rebase for Annotation Offset Adjustment:** Rather than requiring document immutability (which creates friction via draft/finalize flow) or auto-creating versions on every edit (which creates version clutter), Orca uses Google's `diff-match-patch` library to compute text diffs on save and adjust all annotation offsets accordingly. Annotations whose anchored text was destroyed are deleted. This preserves the character-offset annotation model while allowing documents to be freely edited. The tradeoff is that annotations may occasionally be invalidated by edits that remove their anchored text — this is acceptable because it mirrors the natural expectation that if you delete the text someone annotated, the annotation goes away.

- **Architecture Decision #155 — Version Consolidation Is Frontend-Only Grouping:** The backend continues to return all documents for a corpus (including all versions). The frontend's `groupDocsByLineage` helper walks `source_document_id` chains to find version families, then shows only the latest version per lineage. This keeps the backend simple and avoids complex version-aware document listing queries. The version-chain endpoint is lightweight (no body text) and called on demand when viewing a specific document.

### ✅ Completed: Phase 22 — File Upload Workflow & Document-Level Annotations

Two sub-features: replacing the text editor with a file-upload-only document workflow, and replacing offset-based annotations with document-level annotations.

**Philosophy:** Researchers already have documents — preprints, grant applications, protocols, outlines. Orca's value is in annotating and exploring those documents against concept graphs, not in being a text editor. Removing the editor eliminates a major source of bugs (contentEditable cursor/line-break issues) and focuses the product on its core use case: upload → annotate → explore.

- **Phase 22a: File Upload Workflow (replaces text editor)** ✅
  - **Core change:** Removed the in-app text editor entirely. Documents are created exclusively by uploading files. The Phase 21a edit button and `editDocument` endpoint are removed — document updates happen by uploading a new version (existing version chain system from Phase 21c).
  - **Supported file types:** `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf`, `.docx`
  - **Text extraction (backend):**
    - `.txt` and `.md` — read file content directly as UTF-8 text
    - `.pdf` — extract text using `pdf-parse` v1.1.1 (v2.x crashes in Node.js — see Architecture Decision #167)
    - `.docx` — extract text using `mammoth` (`extractRawText`)
    - Other extensions rejected with 400 error
  - **Upload UI:** Drag-and-drop zone + "Choose file" button in both `CorpusTabContent.jsx` and `CorpusDetailView.jsx`. User provides a document title (auto-populated from filename, editable). Optional tag selection (existing tag system). Format is auto-detected from file extension.
  - **Drag-and-drop implementation:** HTML5 `ondragover`/`ondrop` handlers on a styled drop zone div. Visual feedback on drag-over (border highlight, warm brown accent). Zen-aesthetic dashed border. Same file processing pipeline as the file picker button.
  - **Upload endpoint:** `POST /api/corpuses/:corpusId/documents` updated to accept `multipart/form-data` via `multer` (memory storage) with a `file` field. Backend extracts text from the file, stores it in the `body` column. The `format` column stores the detected file type (`'plain'`, `'markdown'`, `'pdf'`, `'docx'`). Optional `title` and `tags` form fields.
  - **Version upload:** `POST /api/corpuses/versions/create` also accepts `multipart/form-data` with file upload + text extraction (replaces the old "copy source body" approach).
  - **File size limit:** 10MB enforced by multer `limits: { fileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024 }`. Custom error middleware catches `LIMIT_FILE_SIZE` and returns 413 with user-friendly message.
  - **Loading indicator:** Spinner + "Uploading…" text in the drop zone during upload. Upload button disabled during upload to prevent double-submission.
  - **Error handling:** All three upload paths (new doc in CorpusTabContent, new doc in CorpusDetailView, version upload) display `err.response?.data?.error` to the user via alert.
  - **Removed:**
    - The `<textarea>` / `contentEditable` document editor in `CorpusTabContent.jsx`
    - The Edit button and edit panel from Phase 21a
    - The `POST /api/corpuses/documents/:id/edit` endpoint
    - The `adjustAnnotationOffsets` helper and `diff-match-patch` dependency
    - The `corpusAPI.editDocument()` frontend method
    - The plain text / markdown format toggle on the upload form
    - Upload body/format state, duplicate check state, live concept links during upload state
  - **Preserved:**
    - Live concept linking on document upload (Phase 7i-4 debounced matching runs after text extraction)
    - Version creation via "Upload new version" (existing Phase 21c flow, now the only way to update a document)
    - All annotation functionality
  - **New backend dependencies:** `pdf-parse` v1.1.1, `mammoth`, `multer`
  - **Removed dependency:** `diff-match-patch`
  - **New frontend state:** `uploadFile`, `uploadDragOver`, `uploadFileError`, `showVersionUpload`, `versionFile`, `versionDragOver`, `versionFileError`, `uploadFileInputRef`, `versionFileInputRef`
  - **New frontend functions:** `validateFileExtension`, `handleFileSelect`, `doFileUpload`, `handleToggleVersionUpload`, `handleVersionFileSelect`, `doVersionUpload`
  - **Removed frontend state:** `uploadBody`, `uploadFormat`, `duplicateMatches`, `checkingDuplicates`, `uploadConceptLinks`, `docEditing`, `editBody`, `savingEdit`
  - **Removed frontend functions:** `handleCheckAndUpload`, `doUpload`, `handleStartDocEdit`, `handleSaveDocEdit`, debounced upload concept links useEffect
  - Files changed: `corpusController.js`, `corpuses.js` routes, `api.js`, `CorpusTabContent.jsx`, `CorpusDetailView.jsx`, `package.json`

- **Phase 22b: Document-Level Annotations with Quote Navigation & Concept Detection Panel** ✅
  - **Core change:** Replaced the offset-based text-selection annotation system with document-level annotations. Annotations attach a concept-in-context to the whole document, with an optional freeform comment and an optional text quote. No character offsets are stored. Text quotes enable clickable navigation to the quoted passage in the document.
  - **Annotation model (new schema):**
    - `quote_text` — optional string quoted from the document. Stored as plain text, not character offsets. Used for click-to-navigate.
    - `comment` — optional freeform text explaining the connection
    - `quote_occurrence` — optional integer indicating which occurrence of the quote string (1-indexed). Stored when the user selects a specific occurrence.
    - `start_position` and `end_position` columns dropped. `valid_positions` CHECK constraint dropped.
  - **Annotation creation — two entry points:**
    1. **"📌 Annotate" button** — always visible in the annotation sidebar header. Opens a form with: quote textarea (optional), comment textarea (optional), concept search field (full graph search). Then context/edge picker (step 2).
    2. **Text selection shortcut** — user selects text in the document body. A small floating 📌 button appears near the selection (positioned via `getBoundingClientRect()`). Clicking it opens the same form with the quote field pre-filled with the selected text.
  - **Quote navigation (click-to-navigate):**
    - Each annotation with a `quote_text` displays the quote in italics in the annotation list. Clicking the quote triggers a runtime string search using `TreeWalker` to find text nodes in the document body, then inserts a `<mark>` element with a fade-out highlight (CSS animation).
    - **Single occurrence:** Navigates directly, scrolls into view with temporary highlight.
    - **Zero occurrences (stale quote):** Quote displays as plain non-clickable text with a "not found" indicator.
  - **Concept detection panel (replaces persistent underlines):**
    - **Removed** persistent concept link underlines from the document body. Documents render as clean, undecorated text.
    - The annotation panel includes a "Concepts in this document" section listing all graphed concept names detected in the document text (same matching logic as `findConceptsInText` — whole-word, case-insensitive, longest-first).
    - Each detected concept shows: concept name with attribute badge, clickable name that opens decontextualized Flip View.
    - **Step-through navigation for concepts:** Down-arrow button (↓) navigates to the first occurrence. Once navigated, shows `‹ n/total ›` with prev/next step buttons. Prev/next wrap around. Case-insensitive matching. State resets when navigating to a different document.
    - "Not found" note appears briefly if the concept name doesn't appear in the document.
    - Uses `document_concept_links_cache` infrastructure repurposed to feed the panel.
  - **Annotation list display:** Each annotation shows concept name (with attribute badge), quote in italics (clickable to navigate), comment text, vote count, layer indicator. Clicking expands inline with full voting/path/color-set/delete UI.
  - **Migration from offset-based annotations:**
    - `quote_text` populated from `SUBSTRING(body FROM start_position + 1 FOR end_position - start_position)` for all existing annotations
    - `quote_occurrence` set to 1 for all migrated annotations
    - `start_position`, `end_position` columns and `valid_positions` CHECK constraint dropped
    - `annotation_removal_log`: `quote_text` column added, `start_position`/`end_position` made nullable (historical records preserved)
  - **Removed:**
    - `buildAnnotatedBody` segment rendering logic (annotation highlights over text spans)
    - Annotation-vs-concept-link priority/overlap logic
    - Character offset storage for annotations
    - `handleTextSelect`, `getTextOffsetInElement`, the old selection toolbar
    - All offset-based state variables
  - **Preserved:**
    - `document_concept_links_cache` table — retained, repurposed to feed concept detection panel
    - Annotation voting (color sets, vote counts) — works the same, displayed alongside comment/quote
    - Public/editorial layer distinction
    - Full graph concept search for annotation creation
  - **Key implementation detail:** The `navigateToQuote` function uses `window.document` explicitly (not `document`) because a React state variable named `document` shadows the global DOM API. The `TreeWalker` approach (`window.document.createTreeWalker`) finds text nodes, creates a `Range`, inserts a `<mark>` element for the highlight, and removes it after a CSS fade-out animation.
  - Files changed: `document_annotations` table (migration), `annotation_removal_log` table (migration), `corpusController.js`, `AnnotationPanel.jsx` (complete redesign), `CorpusTabContent.jsx` (major rewrite — removed buildAnnotatedBody, added quote navigation, text selection handler, concept detection panel), `DecontextualizedDocView.jsx`, `api.js`

- **Architecture Decision #162 — File Upload Only, No In-App Text Editor:** The original Phase 22a planned a `contentEditable` overlay to show concept underlines during editing. Implementation revealed persistent cursor positioning and line-break bugs inherent to `contentEditable`. More fundamentally, Orca's target users (researchers) already have documents in standard formats — the app's value is annotation and exploration, not authoring. Removing the editor eliminates a major bug surface, simplifies the codebase, and focuses the product on its core loop: upload → annotate → explore value graphs. Document updates happen via version uploads (Phase 21c), which is actually a better model for research documents that go through discrete revision cycles.

- **Architecture Decision #163 — Edit Endpoint Removed, Versioning Replaces Editing:** The Phase 21a `editDocument` endpoint (with `diff-match-patch` annotation offset adjustment) is removed because documents can no longer be edited in-place. The version chain system (Phase 21c) replaces it: authors upload a new version, which creates a clean document with fresh annotation opportunities. This is simpler and avoids the complexity of offset rebasing. The `diff-match-patch` dependency is also removed. Note: existing annotations on old versions remain intact and viewable — they simply aren't carried forward to new versions, which is the correct behavior for distinct document revisions.

- **Architecture Decision #164 — Document-Level Annotations Replace Offset-Based Highlighting:** The original annotation system stored character offsets (`start_position`, `end_position`) and rendered colored highlights over text spans. This was replaced with document-level annotations that attach a concept-in-context to the whole document, with an optional freeform comment and optional text quote. The quote is stored as a plain string, not offsets — navigation to the quoted passage uses runtime string search. This eliminates the fragile offset model (which broke on document edits and complicated rendering with overlap logic), simplifies `buildAnnotatedBody` out of existence, and better fits value-graph annotation where the connection between a concept and a document is conceptual rather than tied to a specific character range. Existing offset-based annotations are migrated by extracting the highlighted substring into `quote_text`.

- **Architecture Decision #165 — Concept Detection Panel Replaces Persistent Underlines:** Graphed concept names found in document text were previously shown as persistent underlines throughout the document body, with complex priority logic to avoid overlapping with annotation highlights. This is replaced by a "Concepts in this document" panel in the annotation sidebar, where each detected concept has a clickable name (opens decontextualized Flip View) and a step-through navigator (↓ button to first occurrence, then `‹ n/total ›` prev/next with wrapping). This keeps the document body clean, eliminates the annotation-vs-concept-link overlap logic, and makes concept detection more discoverable and actionable. The panel is always visible to all users, not just during annotation creation. Concept name matching is case-insensitive.

- **Architecture Decision #166 — Quote Occurrence Picker for Ambiguous Navigation:** When a text quote or concept name appears multiple times in a document, clicking "navigate" shows an occurrence picker dropdown with surrounding context (~5-6 words on each side). The annotator selects which occurrence they mean, and the index is stored as `quote_occurrence`. This avoids the need for character offsets while still allowing precise navigation. If a document is versioned and occurrences shift, the worst case is navigating to a different occurrence of the same string — acceptable graceful degradation.

- **Architecture Decision #167 — pdf-parse v1.1.1 Required (Not v2.x):** The `pdf-parse` npm package v2.x completely rearchitected its API. The `/node` entry exported only `{ getHeader }` (not a callable function), and the main entry crashed with `DOMMatrix is not defined` because it assumed a browser environment. v1.1.1 exports the parse function directly and works in Node.js CJS environments. Always use `require('pdf-parse')` (not `require('pdf-parse/node')`).

- **Architecture Decision #168 — Remove process.exit from pg Pool Error Handler:** The `database.js` file had `process.exit(-1)` inside the pg pool's `error` event handler. Any transient PostgreSQL client error (network hiccup, idle timeout) would instantly kill the entire backend process. The Vite proxy would then get connection refused and return 500 for every subsequent API call — including login and root concept loading, which had nothing to do with DB errors. The pg pool already handles reconnection automatically when an idle client drops. The error is now just logged.

- **Architecture Decision #169 — window.document vs React State Variable Shadowing:** In `CorpusTabContent.jsx`, a React state variable named `document` (holding the opened document object `{ id, title, body, ... }`) shadows the global `window.document` DOM API. All DOM API calls in navigation functions (`createTreeWalker`, `createRange`, `createElement`) must use `window.document.*` explicitly. This has caused a `createTreeWalker is not a function` error when `document` resolved to the React state object.

---

### ❌ Cancelled: Phase 23 (formerly) — User-Generated Attributes

**Cancelled.** The original plan to open attribute creation to all users has been replaced by owner-controlled attribute enablement (Phase 25e). The app owner (Miles) will observe how users work with "value" concepts and manually add new attributes as needed by inserting rows into the `attributes` table and updating the `ENABLED_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable. The `user_default_attributes` table is no longer planned. Architecture Decision #137 (user-created attributes are identity-defining) remains valid for any future attributes added by the owner.

---

### ✅ Completed: Phase 23 — Vote Set Drift Tracking

Tracks how users' vote set memberships change over time, enabling users to see where former set-mates have migrated. Hover a vote set swatch to see "top destinations" — the most common current sets among users who previously shared this exact set.

- **Phase 23a: Event Log Infrastructure ✅**
  - New `vote_set_changes` table: append-only event log with `id`, `user_id`, `parent_edge_id`, `child_edge_id`, `action` ('save'/'unsave'), `created_at`
  - Index: `(parent_edge_id, user_id, created_at)` for efficient reconstruction queries
  - Logging wired into `votesController.js`:
    - `addVote`: converted `for...of` to indexed `for` loop so `parent_edge_id = edgeIdsToSave[i-1]` (NULL at index 0 for root edge). Only logs when INSERT actually creates a new vote.
    - `removeVote`: LEFT JOIN maps each removed edge to its parent edge (via `child_id = parent_id` AND `graph_path = graph_path[1:N-1]` with attribute matching). Bulk-inserts 'unsave' events via `unnest`.
    - `addSwapVote`: same parent-edge mapping for Phase 20c cascade removal — logs 'unsave' for saves removed when a swap vote is added.
  - Files changed: `migrate.js`, `votesController.js`

- **Phase 23b: Drift Reconstruction Query ✅**
  - New endpoint: `GET /api/votes/drift/:parentEdgeId` — auth required
  - Implementation in `votesController.js` (`getVoteSetDrift`):
    1. Fetches parent edge to derive child edge criteria (`parent_id = child_id`, `graph_path = path || [child_id]`)
    2. Gets requesting user's current vote set from `votes` table (source of truth)
    3. Loads all `vote_set_changes` events at this parent, grouped by user
    4. Replays each user's events sequentially using a Set — checks if set ever matched requesting user's current set key (sorted edge IDs joined by comma)
    5. For users who ever matched, fetches their actual current vote set from `votes` (handles pre-deployment votes)
    6. Groups departed users by current set key, skips users who re-converged to the same set
    7. Fetches concept names for all involved edge IDs in one query
  - Response: `{ currentSet: [edgeIds], departures: [{ currentSet, userCount, added, removed, conceptNames }] }` sorted by userCount desc
  - Files changed: `votesController.js`, `routes/votes.js`, `api.js`

- **Phase 23c: Drift UI ✅**
  - `VoteSetBar.jsx`:
    - New `driftData` prop, `hoveredSwatchIndex` local state
    - Each swatch wrapped in a `div` with `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave` handlers
    - `onMouseLeave` uses `e.currentTarget.contains(e.relatedTarget)` to keep popover visible as mouse moves from swatch into popover
    - `renderDriftPopover()`: renders only when driftData has departures (up to 3); shows colored dot per departure (matched to existing swatch colors by comparing edgeIds), user count, and `+added; −removed` diff using concept names
    - Clicking a departure dot triggers `onSetClick` for the matched swatch (existing filter behavior)
    - **Popover only renders on the swatch whose child edge IDs match `driftData.currentSet`** — sorted key comparison ensures set equality regardless of order
    - Popover skips rendering entirely if driftData is null or has 0 departures
  - `Concept.jsx`:
    - New `driftData` state; `loadVoteSets` calls `loadDriftData(parentEdgeId)` after successful vote set fetch
    - Only fetches for logged-in users when parentEdgeId is non-null; fire-and-forget with silent error handling
    - Drift data passed to `VoteSetBar`
  - Files changed: `VoteSetBar.jsx`, `Concept.jsx`

- **Bug fix: Drift popover showing on all swatches**
  - Initial implementation showed the same departure data on every swatch. Fixed by comparing the hovered swatch's edge IDs against `driftData.currentSet` — `renderDriftPopover` returns null immediately if they don't match. The popover only appears on the one swatch whose composition equals the current user's vote set.

- **Architecture Decision #155 — Vote Set Drift Uses Append-Only Event Log:** Rather than periodic snapshots (storage-heavy, lossy between snapshots) or modifying existing tables (couples tracking to vote logic), drift tracking uses a dedicated append-only event log. One row per save/unsave event. This is the simplest approach with the best tradeoffs: negligible write overhead (one INSERT per user action), efficient reconstruction (indexed by parent + user + time), no background jobs, and data accumulates naturally from the moment of deployment. Reconstruction queries replay events using window functions to compute historical set membership.

- **Architecture Decision #170 — Drift Popover Only on Matching Swatch:** The drift endpoint returns departure data relative to the requesting user's current vote set. The popover must only appear on the swatch whose child edge composition matches `driftData.currentSet`. Other swatches (including destination sets where departed users landed) show no drift info — they never had members leave. Set equality uses sorted-and-joined edge ID keys for order-independent comparison.

---

### ✅ Completed: Phase 25 — Document & Browse Experience Improvements

Five independent sub-features improving document organization, root page filtering, annotation views, the External Links page, and attribute launch configuration.

- **Phase 25a: Single Tag Per Document** ✅
  - **Schema change:** Added nullable `tag_id` column (FK to `document_tags`) on the `documents` table. Dropped `document_tag_links` junction table after migration.
  - **Migration:** Idempotent `ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN tag_id`. If `document_tag_links` existed, copied earliest assigned tag per document (by `created_at`), then dropped the junction table.
  - **Permission change:** Only the document uploader (`uploaded_by`) can assign or change the tag. Returns 403 for non-uploaders. Replaces the previous model where any logged-in user could assign tags.
  - **Backend changes (corpusController.js — 6 functions updated):**
    - `getCorpus` — replaced junction table subquery with `LEFT JOIN document_tags dt ON dt.id = d.tag_id`, returns `json_build_array(...)` or `'[]'`
    - `uploadDocument` — replaced `INSERT INTO document_tag_links` loop with `UPDATE documents SET tag_id = tagIds[0]`
    - `assignDocumentTag` — checks `uploaded_by === userId` (403 for non-uploader), uses recursive CTE to propagate tag across full version chain (walks up via `source_document_id` to root, then down to all versions)
    - `removeDocumentTag` — same uploader check and recursive CTE, sets `tag_id = NULL` across all versions
    - `getDocumentTags` — queries `documents JOIN document_tags ON d.tag_id`
    - `getAnnotationsForEdge` — tags fetched via `documents JOIN document_tags ON d.tag_id`; also added `d.uploaded_by` to the query (used by Phase 25d)
    - `listDocumentTags` — usage count via `COUNT(d.id)` from `documents` instead of junction table
  - **Version chain tag propagation:** `createVersion` fetches `tag_id` from source doc and passes it into the INSERT, so new versions inherit the tag automatically. `assignDocumentTag` and `removeDocumentTag` use recursive CTEs to update all versions in a chain simultaneously.
  - **Frontend (CorpusTabContent.jsx):**
    - Upload form: label → "Tag (optional):", `handleAddUploadTag` replaces (not appends), `handleCreateAndAddUploadTag` sets single tag
    - Tag assignment/removal state updates replace (not append/filter from) the tags array
    - 🏷 button and ✕ pill gated on `doc.uploaded_by === user?.id`; 🏷 title says "Change tag" when tag is set
  - **CorpusDetailView.jsx & WebLinksView.jsx:** No changes required — both already display tags as read-only pills, and the `doc.tags` array format (now ≤1 item) is handled correctly by existing code.
  - Files changed: `migrate.js`, `corpusController.js`, `routes/documents.js`, `api.js`, `CorpusTabContent.jsx`

- **Phase 25e: Value-Only Launch Mode (Attribute Shelving)** ✅
  - **Migration:** UPDATEs all edges to set `attribute_id` to the "value" attribute's ID (idempotent, skips rows already set to value). One collision was deduplicated (105 → 104 edges), votes were reassigned to the kept edge.
  - **Environment variable:** Added `ENABLED_ATTRIBUTES` to backend `.env` and created `.env.example` with sanitized config. Currently set to `value,action,tool,question` (all four attributes enabled).
  - **Backend (conceptsController.js):** `getAttributes` reads `ENABLED_ATTRIBUTES` env var. If set, filters returned attributes to only those names (comma-separated). If unset, returns all attributes (backwards compatible).
  - **Frontend (SearchField.jsx):** When only one attribute is returned from the endpoint, `handleCreateRootClick` skips the attribute picker and auto-assigns the single attribute directly. The `handleAttributeSelect` function accepts an optional `actionOverride` parameter to support this bypass.
  - **Changing enabled attributes:** Update `.env` `ENABLED_ATTRIBUTES` to any comma-separated subset (e.g., `value,action,tool,question`), restart the backend. Existing concepts are unaffected. New root concepts can choose from enabled attributes.
  - Files changed: `migrate.js`, `.env`, `.env.example`, `conceptsController.js`, `SearchField.jsx`

- **Phase 25b: Root Page Attribute Filter** ✅
  - Filter bar on the root page: **All | Action | Tool | Value**. Default selection: **Value**.
  - Filters root concept cards client-side by the attribute on their root edge (`attribute_id`).
  - **Persistence:** Stored in `localStorage` under key `orca_root_attribute_filter`. Persists across sessions and page reloads. Defaults to "Value" if stored value is invalid or missing.
  - **Phase 25e interaction:** Filter bar does not render when only one attribute is enabled (nothing to filter). When the owner enables more attributes via `ENABLED_ATTRIBUTES`, the filter bar appears automatically.
  - Files changed: `Root.jsx`

- **Phase 25c: Author Annotation View & Author-Only Versioning** ✅
  - **New annotation filter:** Fourth option added to the layer filter toggle: **All | Public | Editorial | Author**
  - "Author" shows only annotations where `document_annotations.created_by` matches the document's `documents.uploaded_by` (via subquery). Visible to all users viewing the document, not just the author.
  - **Layer badges:** Collapsed annotation headers now show "editorial" badge (green, was previously abbreviated "ed") and "public" badge (blue-ish, `#5a5a7a` text / `#f0f0f8` background) for visual distinction.
  - **Author-only version creation:** `POST /corpuses/versions/create` restricted to the document's `uploaded_by` user only. Returns 403 with message "Only the document author can create new versions" for non-uploaders.
  - Files changed: `corpusController.js`, `CorpusTabContent.jsx`

- **Phase 25d: WebLinksView Annotation Cleanup & Surfaced Sections** ✅
  - **Annotation display fix:** The annotation system was migrated from character-offset excerpts to document-level annotations (quote_text/comment) in Phase 22b, but WebLinksView was still referencing the old excerpt format (showing empty strings). Fixed:
    - `getAnnotationSentence` rewritten to work with the document-level model — now takes `(body, quoteText, quoteOccurrence)` instead of `(body, startOffset, endOffset)`. Locates the Nth occurrence of the quote text in the document body, then expands outward to sentence boundaries using the same logic as before.
    - Annotation rendering replaced legacy `ann.textSnippet`/`ann.startPosition`/`ann.endPosition` references with: if `ann.quoteText` exists → show it (with sentence expansion); if `ann.comment` exists → show it below; if neither → fallback to "Annotation on [document title]".
    - Extracted rendering into a shared `renderAnnotations(doc)` helper used consistently in all three sections.
    - New styles: `snippetComment` (darker, non-italic for comments), `snippetFallback` (grey italic for fallback).
  - **Backend:** Added `d.uploaded_by` to the `getAnnotationsForEdge` query, passed as `uploadedBy` on each document object (used by My Documents filtering).
  - **New "My Documents" section:** Collapsible section at top of Document Annotations area. Filters documents where `uploadedBy === user.id`. Shows corpus context label. Default expanded with ▾/▸ toggle.
  - **New "Documents in My Corpuses" section:** Below My Documents. Filters documents from subscribed corpuses (fetched via `corpusAPI.getMySubscriptions` on mount), excluding documents already in "My Documents." Grouped by corpus with headers. Default expanded, collapsible.
  - **Main listing unchanged:** The full "Document Annotations" listing below remains complete and unfiltered — items may appear in both surfaced sections and the main listing (intentional, see Architecture Decision #159).
  - **Guest users:** Neither surfaced section renders for guests.
  - Files changed: `corpusController.js`, `WebLinksView.jsx`

- **Architecture Decision #156 — Single Tag Per Document Is a Type, Not an Attribute:** Document tags in Orca represent document *types* (preprint, protocol, grant application, outline). A document has exactly one type. The multi-tag junction table model was replaced with a direct `tag_id` column because the many-to-many relationship encouraged ambiguous classification. Only the document uploader can assign/change the type, ensuring the author controls how their work is categorized.

- **Architecture Decision #157 — Root Page Attribute Filter Defaults to Value:** The root page filter defaults to "Value" rather than "All" because value-attribute graphs represent the highest-level motivational concepts (principles, goals, differentiators) that are the most natural entry point for new users exploring the ontology. Users who want to see tool or action graphs can switch with one click. The filter persists in `localStorage` so returning users see their preferred view.

- **Architecture Decision #158 — Author Annotation View Is Universally Visible:** The "Author" annotation filter shows annotations created by the document's uploader, and this filter is available to all users — not just the author. This supports Orca's transparency philosophy: any reader can see what the author themselves considered worth annotating, which provides useful signal about the document's intended emphasis and structure.

- **Architecture Decision #159 — WebLinksView Surfaced Sections Duplicate the Main Listing:** The "My Documents" and "My Corpuses" sections in WebLinksView are convenience shortcuts that surface relevant content at the top. They do NOT exclude items from the main "Document Annotations" listing below. This means some documents appear twice on the page. The alternative (excluding from the main listing) would mean collapsing the top sections hides content from view, which violates the principle that the full dataset should always be accessible in one place.

- **Architecture Decision #160 — Author-Only Version Creation:** Only the original document uploader (`uploaded_by`) can create new versions of their document. This tightens the previous permission model where any allowed user of a corpus could create versions. The rationale: versioning represents the author's own revision of their work, not community editing. Community input happens through annotations, not through modifying the document itself.

- **Architecture Decision #161 — Environment Variable Toggle for Attribute Enablement:** Rather than removing the multi-attribute infrastructure, Orca controls which attributes are available via an `ENABLED_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable. All four attributes (action, tool, value, question) are enabled at launch. The `attributes` table, `attribute_id` column on edges, and all display code remain intact. The owner enables or disables attributes by updating the environment variable and restarting — no code changes or migrations needed. The original Phase 23 (user-generated attributes open to all users) was cancelled in favor of this owner-controlled model.

- **Architecture Decision #162 — WebLinksView Annotation Display Uses Shared Renderer:** After Phase 22b migrated annotations from character-offset excerpts to document-level annotations (quote_text/comment), WebLinksView was still referencing legacy fields and showing empty strings. The fix extracted annotation rendering into a shared `renderAnnotations(doc)` helper used by all three sections (My Documents, My Corpuses, main listing). The `getAnnotationSentence` function was rewritten to accept `(body, quoteText, quoteOccurrence)` and locate the Nth occurrence of quote text in the document body before expanding to sentence boundaries. This ensures consistent rendering across the entire page.

- **Architecture Decision #163 — Version Chain Tag Propagation Via Recursive CTE:** When a document's tag is assigned or removed, the change must propagate to all versions in the chain. Rather than requiring the frontend to track all version IDs, the backend uses a recursive CTE that walks up via `source_document_id` to find the root document, then walks back down to collect all descendant versions, and updates `tag_id` on the whole chain in a single query. This keeps tag consistency automatic regardless of which version the user is viewing when they change the tag.

---

### Phase 26: Annotation Model Overhaul (✅ COMPLETE)

A comprehensive rework of the annotation system to align annotations with Orca's core philosophy: nothing is deleted, quality emerges from community voting, and identity-based filtering replaces stored layer categories. Also introduces document co-authorship and simplifies corpus member management UI.

**Key Principles:**
- Annotations are permanent (like concepts) — no deletion, vote-based sorting buries low-quality annotations
- The annotation filter (All | Corpus Members | Author) is computed at query time from user identities, not from a stored `layer` column
- "Author" means the document uploader OR any co-author (stored at the version-chain level)
- "Corpus Member" means the corpus owner OR any allowed user (existing `corpus_allowed_users` table)
- Any user can vote on any annotation; voting restrictions by layer are removed
- Auto-vote on annotation creation (creator automatically endorses their annotation)
- Provenance badges ("Added by author", "Voted by corpus member", etc.) replace layer badges
- View-gated annotation creation prevents the UX confusion of adding an annotation invisible in the current filter

#### Phase 26a: Co-Author Infrastructure

**New Tables:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE document_authors (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  document_id INTEGER REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  invited_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(document_id, user_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_document_authors_document ON document_authors(document_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_document_authors_user ON document_authors(user_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- `document_id` references the **root document** in the version chain (where `source_document_id IS NULL`). Co-authorship applies to the entire lineage, not individual versions.
- When checking co-author status for any version, the backend walks up the `source_document_id` chain to find the root, then checks `document_authors` for that root ID. Same recursive CTE pattern used for tag propagation.
- The original uploader (`documents.uploaded_by`) is implicitly an author — not stored in `document_authors`, checked by ownership (same pattern as corpus owner vs `corpus_allowed_users`).
- Any author (uploader or co-author) can generate invite tokens and remove other co-authors.
- Co-authors can create new versions (updates the Phase 25c/Architecture Decision #160 restriction to check `uploaded_by` OR `document_authors` membership via root document lookup).
- No document locking or version conflict warnings needed — uploading a new version just adds a new row to the chain; parallel uploads by different co-authors are fine.

```sql
CREATE TABLE document_invite_tokens (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  document_id INTEGER REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  token VARCHAR(64) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  max_uses INTEGER,
  use_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE INDEX idx_document_invite_tokens_document ON document_invite_tokens(document_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_document_invite_tokens_token ON document_invite_tokens(token);
```

**Key Points:**
- Modeled identically to `corpus_invite_tokens` but with `document_id` instead of `corpus_id`.
- `document_id` references the root document in the version chain (same as `document_authors`).
- `token` is a 48-character URL-safe random string generated via `crypto.randomBytes`.
- Any author (uploader or co-author) can generate tokens.
- Accepting a token adds the user to `document_authors` for the root document.

**New Endpoints (on `/api/corpuses` or a new `/api/documents` sub-route):**

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/documents/:documentId/invite/generate` | Author only | Generate an invite token for a document's co-author group |
| POST | `/documents/invite/accept` | Required | Accept an invite token to become a co-author |
| GET | `/documents/:documentId/authors` | Author only (list), Guest (count) | Get co-author count (all users) or full list with usernames (authors only) |
| POST | `/documents/:documentId/authors/remove` | Author only | Remove a co-author from the document |
| POST | `/documents/:documentId/authors/leave` | Required | Leave as a co-author (self-removal) |

**Version creation permission update:**
- `POST /corpuses/versions/create` currently checks `uploaded_by === userId`. Will be updated to also check `document_authors` membership via root document lookup. Co-authors can create versions from any corpus the document appears in.

**Frontend changes:**
- New invite acceptance route (e.g., `/doc-invite/:token`) — similar to `/invite/:token` for corpuses
- Co-author count display visible to all users in the document viewer header
- Author management panel visible only to authors: shows co-author usernames with remove buttons, invite token generation
- "Leave" button for co-authors to remove themselves

#### Phase 26b: Corpus Member UI Simplification

**Changes to Allowed Users panel in CorpusDetailView:**
- **Public-facing display:** Count only ("N corpus members") — replaces the full member list visible to all allowed users
- **Corpus owner view:** Retains username list with remove buttons (owner needs to identify members for removal)
- **Member self-service:** "Leave corpus" button for members to remove themselves
- **Retire `display_name` functionality:** Stop reading/writing `corpus_allowed_users.display_name` — column stays in database (dormant)
- **Remove removal log display:** The annotation removal log panel is removed from the Allowed Users UI since annotation deletion is being removed in Phase 26c. The `annotation_removal_log` table stays dormant.
- **Remove `POST /allowed-users/display-name` endpoint** (or leave dormant)
- **Update `GET /:corpusId/allowed-users`:** Returns full list only if requester is corpus owner; returns count only for other allowed users and non-members

#### Phase 26c: Annotation Permanence + Auto-Vote + Cleanup

**Annotation permanence:**
- Remove `POST /annotations/delete` endpoint (or return 410 Gone)
- Remove all annotation deletion UI: delete buttons in AnnotationPanel, confirmation dialogs, deletion handlers in CorpusTabContent
- Retire `annotation_removal_log` code references — remove the `GET /:corpusId/removal-log` endpoint (or leave dormant), remove frontend removal log display
- The `annotation_removal_log` table remains in the database (append-only philosophy — don't drop tables)

**Auto-vote on annotation creation:**
- When `createAnnotation` succeeds, also INSERT into `annotation_votes` (same transaction or immediately after)
- This ensures the creator's annotation starts with 1 vote and appears in any filter view that includes the creator's identity
- If the creator later wants to "un-endorse" their own annotation, they can remove their vote like any other voter

**Remove editorial-layer voting restriction:**
- Currently, `voteOnAnnotation` and `voteAnnotationColorSet` check if the annotation is on the editorial layer and reject non-allowed users. Remove this check — any logged-in user can vote on any annotation.

**Remove color set voting from annotations:**
- Remove backend endpoints: `POST /annotations/color-set/vote`, `POST /annotations/color-set/unvote`, `GET /annotations/:annotationId/color-sets`
- Remove frontend: "🎨 Color set preference" button, color set picker UI, related state variables in CorpusTabContent
- Leave `annotation_color_set_votes` table dormant in database

**Layer column handling:**
- Stop writing meaningful `layer` values on new annotations. The column has `NOT NULL DEFAULT 'public'`, so new annotations will get `'public'` harmlessly.
- The `layer` column is ignored by the new filter logic (Phase 26d) — it no longer drives any behavior.
- Do not drop the column (append-only philosophy).

#### Phase 26d: New Filter Model (Backend)

**Rewrite `getDocumentAnnotations` query:**

The current `?layer=public|editorial|author` parameter is replaced with `?filter=all|corpus_members|author`.

- **`filter=all` (default):** Returns ALL annotations for the document in this corpus, sorted by vote count descending. Each annotation is enriched with four boolean badges:
  - `addedByAuthor` — true if the annotation's `created_by` is the document uploader (`documents.uploaded_by`) OR is in `document_authors` for the root document
  - `votedByAuthor` — true if any author (uploader or co-author) has a row in `annotation_votes` for this annotation
  - `addedByCorpusMember` — true if the annotation's `created_by` is the corpus owner (`corpuses.created_by`) OR is in `corpus_allowed_users` for this corpus
  - `votedByCorpusMember` — true if any corpus member (owner or allowed user) has a row in `annotation_votes` for this annotation

- **`filter=corpus_members`:** Returns annotations WHERE:
  - The creator (`created_by`) is a corpus member (corpus owner or in `corpus_allowed_users`), OR
  - At least one corpus member has voted for it (EXISTS in `annotation_votes` joined with `corpus_allowed_users` / `corpuses.created_by`)
  - Sorted by vote count descending
  - Enriched with `addedByAuthor` and `votedByAuthor` badges (corpus member status is implicit in this view)

- **`filter=author`:** Returns annotations WHERE:
  - The creator (`created_by`) is an author (document uploader or in `document_authors` via root doc), OR
  - At least one author has voted for it (EXISTS in `annotation_votes` joined with `document_authors` / `documents.uploaded_by`)
  - Sorted by vote count descending
  - No provenance badges needed (author status is implicit in this view)

**Author identity resolution:**
- For any document version, walk up `source_document_id` to find the root document
- Check `documents.uploaded_by` on the root document (original uploader)
- Check `document_authors` for the root document ID (co-authors)
- This set of user IDs = "authors" for filtering and badge computation

**Corpus member identity resolution:**
- Check `corpuses.created_by` for the current corpus (corpus owner)
- Check `corpus_allowed_users` for the current corpus (allowed users)
- This set of user IDs = "corpus members" for filtering and badge computation

**Promotion behavior:**
- When a public user becomes a corpus member (added to `corpus_allowed_users`), their existing annotations and votes on documents in that corpus automatically appear in the Corpus Members filter — no data migration needed, because the filter is computed at query time from current user identities.
- When a user becomes a co-author (added to `document_authors`), their existing annotations and votes on that document automatically appear in the Author filter — same query-time computation.

#### Phase 26e: New Filter Model (Frontend)

**Filter toggle:**
- **All | Corpus Members | Author** (replaces old All | Public | Editorial | Author)
- Default: **All**

**Provenance badges on annotations (italic EB Garamond):**
- In **All** view: show applicable badges — "(author)", "(author endorsed)", "(corpus member)", "(corpus member endorsed)". "Endorsed" variant only shows if the annotation wasn't directly added by that identity (avoids redundancy).
- In **Corpus Members** view: show author-related badges only — "(author)", "(author endorsed)" (corpus member status is implicit)
- In **Author** view: no provenance badges needed (author status is implicit)

**Auto-jump on annotation creation (replaces originally planned view-gating):**
- The annotation creation button is visible to ALL logged-in users in ALL filter views — capability is never hidden.
- After creating an annotation, the frontend checks whether the creator belongs to the current filter's identity group. If not (e.g., a non-author creates while viewing the Author filter), the filter automatically switches to "All" before reloading annotations. If the creator does belong, the view stays.
- Rationale: instead of hiding the creation button (which removes capability), the UI adapts to always show the user what they just did.

**Co-author management UI:**
- Placement: in the document viewer header, consistent with corpus member management in CorpusDetailView
- All users see: co-author count ("N co-authors" or "1 author")
- Authors see: clickable count that toggles a management panel — co-author usernames with remove buttons, invite token generation, "Leave" button (for co-authors, not the original uploader)

**Members panel in CorpusTabContent:**
- Members button added to CorpusTabContent action row (matching CorpusDetailView)
- Owner sees invite links + full member list with remove buttons
- Non-owners see count only + leave button for allowed users
- Delete Corpus button also added to CorpusTabContent action row

**Architecture Decisions (Phase 26):**

- **Architecture Decision #171 — Lineage-Level Co-Authorship Via Root Document:** Co-authorship is stored against the root document in the version chain (`source_document_id IS NULL`), not against individual versions. The `document_authors` table references the root document ID. When checking co-author status for any version, the backend walks up the `source_document_id` chain via recursive CTE to find the root, then checks `document_authors`. This ensures the co-author group identity persists across all versions — it belongs to the project/lineage, not to individual revision snapshots. Invite tokens also reference the root document. When a new version is created by any author, the co-author list automatically applies to it.

- **Architecture Decision #172 — Annotation Permanence (No Deletion, Vote-Based Sorting):** Annotations can no longer be deleted. This mirrors the concept model where nothing is ever removed, only buried by community voting. Bad or irrelevant annotations naturally sink to the bottom via low vote counts. The `annotation_removal_log` table and all deletion UI are retired. The `POST /annotations/delete` endpoint is removed. This eliminates the moderation complexity of tracking who removed what and why — the community curates through endorsement, not removal.

- **Architecture Decision #173 — Filter-By-Identity Replaces Stored Layer Column:** The annotation filter system shifts from a stored `layer` column (`public`/`editorial`) to query-time identity resolution. The three filter views (All, Corpus Members, Author) are computed by checking whether the annotation's creator or any of its voters belong to the relevant identity group (authors = uploader + `document_authors`; corpus members = corpus owner + `corpus_allowed_users`). This means the same annotation can appear in multiple filter views without duplication — a public user's annotation that receives a corpus member's vote appears in both All and Corpus Members views. The `layer` column on `document_annotations` is retained but ignored; new annotations default to `'public'` harmlessly.

- **Architecture Decision #174 — Auto-Vote On Annotation Creation:** Creating an annotation automatically inserts a vote in `annotation_votes` for the creator. This ensures every annotation starts with at least 1 vote, the creator's annotation appears in any identity-based filter that includes them (e.g., an author's annotation immediately appears in the Author view), and the creator can later remove their vote if they change their mind — unlike the old model where creation was permanent endorsement, this model allows the creator to "withdraw support" from their own annotation while the annotation itself remains (permanence).

- **Architecture Decision #175 — Co-Author/Corpus Member Management Shows Counts Publicly, Usernames to Members/Authors (Updated Phase 28e):** The public-facing display for both corpus members and document co-authors shows only a count ("N corpus members", "N co-authors"). For corpus members: usernames are visible to ALL corpus members (owner + allowed users), not just the owner. The owner retains remove buttons; non-owner members see the list read-only (plus their own "Leave" button). For co-authors: usernames are visible to all authors (uploader + co-authors), who can also remove other co-authors. Non-members/non-authors see counts only. The `display_name` field on `corpus_allowed_users` is retired — invite tokens handle identity coordination in real life. *(Originally, only the corpus owner could see member usernames; relaxed in Phase 28e.)*

- **Architecture Decision #176 — Auto-Jump Replaces View-Gated Annotation Creation:** The original Phase 26e plan called for hiding the annotation creation button when the user didn't belong to the current filter's identity group (e.g., hiding it from non-authors in the Author view). This was replaced with an auto-jump approach: the creation button is always visible to all logged-in users, and after creation the filter automatically switches to a view where the new annotation is visible. This preserves capability (users can always annotate) while ensuring they see their work. The principle: capability is never hidden; the UI adapts to show you what you did.

---

**Key Bug Patterns (Phase 26):**

- **Naive one-level-up root lookup causes duplicate version numbers:** The `createVersion` endpoint originally used `sourceDoc.source_document_id || sourceDoc.id` to find the "root" — but this only goes one level up, not to the actual root. For a chain v1←v2←v3←v4, creating from v3 would compute rootDocId = v2, missing parts of the chain. Fix: always use `getRootDocumentId()` (recursive CTE utility) for any operation that needs the root document. This pattern applies to co-author lookups, tag propagation, and version number computation.
- **Frontend document lineage grouping breaks with gaps in corpus membership:** `groupDocsByLineage` walked the `source_document_id` chain using only documents present in the corpus. When intermediate versions are missing from the corpus (e.g., v1 and v3 are in the corpus but v2 is not), the chain walk breaks. Fix: backend now computes `root_document_id` via recursive CTE over the full `documents` table and returns it with each document. Frontend uses `root_document_id` for reliable grouping regardless of corpus membership gaps.
- **"My Documents" filter must account for version chain uploaders:** Filtering `documents.filter(doc => doc.uploaded_by === user.id)` breaks chain resolution because it excludes versions uploaded by other users in the same chain. Fix: group ALL documents into chains first, track `_chainUploaders` (set of all uploaders in the chain), then filter chains where the user is any uploader.

### Phase 27: Annotations Panel Overhaul (✅ COMPLETE)

Transforms annotations from a separate page (behind a 🔗 Links button) into an always-visible right panel on the concept page. The concept page becomes a two-column layout: children/flip view on the left, annotation panel on the right. Annotations are aggregated across ALL parent contexts for the leaf concept (cross-context), shown in a flat vote-sorted list. The panel has two tabs: **Annotations** (default) and **Web Links**. Retires `WebLinksView.jsx`, `FlipLinksView.jsx`, and the `'links'`/`'fliplinks'` view modes.

#### Phase 27a: Two-Column Layout + View Mode Retirement
**Layout change (`Concept.jsx`):**
- Split the concept page into a two-column layout: left side renders children grid (or Flip View cards), right side renders a new annotation panel component
- The annotation panel is always visible in both Children view and Flip View — it's scoped to the leaf concept, not the current edge
- Remove the 🔗 **Links** button from the concept header bar entirely
- Remove the `'links'` view mode and `handleToggleLinksView` handler
- Remove the `'fliplinks'` view mode and `handleOpenFlipLinks` handler
- Remove the 🔗 **All Links** button from `FlipView.jsx`

**Component retirement:**
- `WebLinksView.jsx` — retired. Its annotation display and web links display are absorbed into the new panel component
- `FlipLinksView.jsx` — retired. Cross-context web links are now handled by the Web Links tab in the panel (using the existing `getAllWebLinksForConcept` endpoint)

**New component:**
- Create `AnnotationPanel.jsx` (or similar name — note: there is an existing `AnnotationPanel.jsx` used inside `CorpusTabContent` for annotation *creation*; the new panel component needs a distinct name, e.g., `ConceptAnnotationPanel.jsx`)
- The panel has two tabs at the top: **Annotations** | **Web Links**
- Annotations tab is the default view
- Web Links tab uses the existing `getAllWebLinksForConcept` endpoint to show cross-context web links

**Files expected:** `Concept.jsx` (layout split, remove Links button/view modes), `FlipView.jsx` (remove All Links button), new `ConceptAnnotationPanel.jsx`, retire `WebLinksView.jsx` and `FlipLinksView.jsx`

#### Phase 27b: Cross-Context Annotation Endpoint + Panel Rendering
**New backend endpoint (`corpusController.js`):**
- `GET /api/corpuses/annotations/concept/:conceptId` — new endpoint that fetches all annotations for a concept across ALL edges (parent contexts) and ALL corpuses
- Joins `document_annotations` → `edges` (where `edges.child_id = :conceptId`) → `documents` → `corpuses` to aggregate cross-context
- Each annotation object in the response includes:
  - `annotationId`, `quoteText`, `comment`, `createdAt`
  - `voteCount`, `userVoted` (if logged in)
  - `documentId`, `documentTitle`, `documentVersionNumber`
  - `corpusId`, `corpusName`
  - `tagId`, `tagName` (document's type tag)
  - `creatorUsername`
  - `edgeId`, `parentConceptName`, `parentPath` (parent context provenance — so the card can show which parent context this annotation is from)
- Query parameters:
  - `?sort=votes` (default): `ORDER BY vote_count DESC, created_at DESC`
  - `?sort=new`: `ORDER BY created_at DESC`
  - `?tagId=N`: filter to annotations on documents with this tag
  - `?corpusIds=1,2,3`: filter to annotations in these corpuses (comma-separated)
- Guest-accessible (optionalAuth — `userVoted` is null for guests)
- The existing `getAnnotationsForEdge` endpoint is preserved (still used by `CorpusTabContent` for edge-scoped annotation loading within a document viewer) but is no longer called from the concept page

**Frontend panel rendering (`ConceptAnnotationPanel.jsx`):**
- Annotations tab shows a flat list of annotation cards, each displaying:
  - Document title (clickable — navigates to corpus tab + document)
  - Corpus name
  - Parent context path (e.g., "Root > Parent > [leaf concept]") — shows which edge/context the annotation is from
  - Quote text (if present), comment (if present)
  - Vote count with vote/unvote button (for logged-in users)
  - Creator username, date
  - Tag pill (if the document has a type tag)
- Two sort toggle buttons: **Annotation Votes** (default) and **Newest**
- The panel calls the new endpoint on mount, passing `conceptId` (the leaf concept being viewed)

**Frontend API (`api.js`):**
- New `getAnnotationsForConcept(conceptId, { sort, tagId, corpusIds })` API method

**Route registration (`corpuses.js`):**
- New route `GET /annotations/concept/:conceptId` — must be placed before `/:id` parameterized routes (same pattern as other annotation routes)

#### Phase 27c: Tag Filter + My Corpuses Filter + Pending Annotation Navigation
**Tag filter:**
- Tag filter pills in the annotation panel (same UX as before — pills for each document type tag, clickable to filter)
- Passes `tagId` to the backend via the updated API call

**My Corpuses filter:**
- **"My Corpuses"** toggle button/pill in the filter area (near tag filter, independent of it)
- When toggled ON:
  - Fetch the user's subscribed corpuses via `corpusAPI.getMySubscriptions` (already available)
  - Display subscribed corpus names as clickable pills below the toggle
  - With no specific corpus pill selected: filter to annotations from ALL subscribed corpuses (pass all subscribed corpus IDs as `corpusIds`)
  - Clicking a specific corpus pill: filter to only that corpus (pass single corpus ID)
  - Clicking the active corpus pill again: deselect, return to all subscribed corpuses
- Tag filtering and My Corpuses filtering are independent — both can be active at the same time
- "My Corpuses" toggle hidden for guest users

**Pending annotation navigation (new infrastructure):**
- Extends the existing `pendingDocumentId` pattern (Architecture Decision #80) with a new `pendingAnnotationId`
- When a user clicks an annotation card in the panel to navigate to the document:
  - `onOpenCorpusTab(corpusId, corpusName, documentId, annotationId)` — passes the annotation ID alongside the document ID
  - `AppShell` stores `pendingAnnotationId` in state (alongside existing `pendingCorpusDocumentId`)
  - `CorpusTabContent` receives `pendingAnnotationId` as a prop
  - After the document loads and annotations are fetched, `CorpusTabContent` finds the annotation with the matching ID in the annotation list, expands/selects it in the annotation panel, and scrolls it into view
  - `pendingAnnotationId` is cleared via callback after consumption (same pattern as `onPendingDocumentConsumed`)
- If the annotation has a `quoteText`, the existing quote-navigation mechanism (runtime string search → `<mark>` highlight) should also fire so the user sees both the annotation panel selection AND the highlighted quote in the document body

**Files expected:** `ConceptAnnotationPanel.jsx` (filter UI), `api.js` (query param passing), `Concept.jsx` (prop threading), `AppShell.jsx` (new `pendingAnnotationId` state), `CorpusTabContent.jsx` (pending annotation consumption + scroll-to-annotation logic)

#### Phase 27d: Responsive Layout
- On narrow screens (mobile / small browser windows), the two-column layout stacks vertically: children/flip grid on top, annotation panel below
- CSS breakpoint determines the threshold (implementation decision for Claude Code — likely around 768px or 900px)
- The panel retains full functionality when stacked; it just takes full width instead of the right column

**Files expected:** `Concept.jsx` (responsive CSS), `ConceptAnnotationPanel.jsx` (responsive adjustments if needed)

**Architecture Decisions (Phase 27):**

- **Architecture Decision #177 — Annotations as Always-Visible Panel, Not Separate Page:** The External Links page (WebLinksView.jsx) is retired in favor of an always-visible annotation panel on the right side of the concept page. This positions document annotations front-and-center during graph navigation — the purpose of exploring graphs is to find and explore documents, so annotations should be immediately visible rather than hidden behind a button click. The panel persists across Children view and Flip View, reinforcing that annotations are a primary output of the concept hierarchy, not a secondary feature.

- **Architecture Decision #178 — Cross-Context Annotation Aggregation for Leaf Concept:** The annotation panel aggregates annotations from ALL parent contexts (edges) for the current leaf concept, not just the current edge. This is the annotation equivalent of what FlipView does for parent contexts and what FlipLinksView did for web links. Each annotation card shows its parent context path so users know which edge the annotation came from. The underlying data model is unchanged — annotations are still stored per-edge in `document_annotations`. The new `getAnnotationsForConcept` endpoint simply joins across all edges where the concept appears as a child. The existing `getAnnotationsForEdge` endpoint is preserved for use within `CorpusTabContent` (document-level annotation viewing).

- **Architecture Decision #179 — Flat Vote-Sorted Annotation List Replaces Corpus-Grouped Display:** Individual annotations are the atomic unit in a flat, vote-sorted list. Previously, annotations were grouped by corpus → document in collapsible sections. The flat model aligns with Orca's voting philosophy: the best annotations rise to the top regardless of which corpus or parent context they belong to. Corpus and parent context are still visible on each annotation card (provenance), but they no longer drive organizational structure. Architecture Decision #159 (surfaced sections duplicate the main listing) is retired — the "My Documents" and "Documents in My Corpuses" sections are removed entirely, replaced by a "My Corpuses" filter toggle.

- **Architecture Decision #180 — My Corpuses as Filter, Not Section:** The Phase 25d approach of surfacing "My Documents" and "Documents in My Corpuses" as separate sections above the main listing is replaced by a "My Corpuses" toggle filter. When active, it restricts the flat list to annotations from the user's subscribed corpuses, with optional narrowing to a specific corpus via clickable pills. This is simpler (one list, one sort order) and composable (My Corpuses + tag filter can both be active). The user always sees a single sorted list; they just control what's in it.

- **Architecture Decision #181 — Server-Side Filtering for Corpus and Tag:** Tag and corpus filtering are handled by query parameters on the `getAnnotationsForConcept` endpoint rather than client-side filtering. This keeps the frontend simple, avoids loading all annotations and filtering in JavaScript, and is pagination-ready if annotation counts grow large.

- **Architecture Decision #182 — Pending Annotation Navigation Extends Pending Document Pattern:** Clicking an annotation card in the panel to navigate to the document not only opens the document in the corpus tab (existing `pendingDocumentId` pattern) but also auto-selects and scrolls to the specific annotation in the corpus tab's annotation sidebar (new `pendingAnnotationId`). This extends Architecture Decision #80's cross-component navigation pattern. The annotation sidebar selection and the quote-text highlight (if applicable) both fire, giving the user visual confirmation of exactly which annotation they clicked through to see.

- **Architecture Decision #183 — Annotations | Web Links Tab Toggle in Panel:** The right panel uses a tab toggle (Annotations | Web Links) rather than stacking web links below annotations in a single scrolling list. This prevents web links from being buried below a long annotation list and gives each content type its own clean space. The Web Links tab uses the existing `getAllWebLinksForConcept` endpoint (cross-context aggregation, already built in Phase 6c for FlipLinksView).

- **Architecture Decision #184 — WebLinksView and FlipLinksView Retired:** `WebLinksView.jsx` (edge-scoped External Links page) and `FlipLinksView.jsx` (cross-context web links compilation) are both retired. Their functionality is absorbed into the new `ConceptAnnotationPanel.jsx`: annotations tab replaces WebLinksView's document annotations section, web links tab replaces both WebLinksView's web links section and FlipLinksView's cross-context compilation. The `'links'` and `'fliplinks'` view modes in tab navigation state are retired. This reduces the number of distinct view modes and eliminates two components.

- **Architecture Decision #185 — Admin-Controlled Document Tags Mirror Attribute Model:** Document type tags shift from user-generated to owner-controlled, matching the attribute pattern established in Phase 25e. The `ENABLED_DOCUMENT_TAGS` environment variable (comma-separated tag names) gates which tags appear in the picker. The `GET /api/documents/tags` endpoint filters by enabled tags. The `POST /documents/tags/create` endpoint is retired (410 Gone). New tags are added by the owner via database row insertion + env var update + restart. This prevents tag proliferation and gives the owner full control over the document taxonomy, just as they control the concept attribute taxonomy.

### Phase 28: Visual Polish, UI Cleanup & Bug Fixes (✅ COMPLETE)

A sweep of visual refinements, feature removals, and bug fixes to bring Orca to launch-quality polish. Organized into seven sub-phases that can each be committed independently.

**Key Principles:**
- Strip remaining visual clutter (icons, colors) to match Zen aesthetic — only vote set swatches provide color
- Ensure EB Garamond typography is consistent everywhere
- Remove vestigial features (ranking, supergroups, back buttons) that are no longer needed
- Fix bugs found during pre-launch testing
- Convert login from a standalone page to an inline modal for seamless guest-to-user transition
- Expand concept name limit to support research questions (now the [question] attribute)

#### Phase 28a: Visual Cleanup — Icons, Fonts, Colors

**Icon Removal:**
- Remove 📚 icon from corpus items in the sidebar
- Remove 📚 icon from the Browse button in the sidebar
- Remove the icon from the Flip View / Children View toggle button (keep text only)
- Remove the icon from the Share button (📋) — keep text "Share" only
- Remove the 📌 icon from the Annotate button — change to the word "Annotate"
- Remove the icon from the document tag button (🏷) — change to the word "Add tag" (or "Change tag" when a tag is already set)
- Remove the icon from the Members button when viewing a corpus — keep text "Members" only
- Remove 📚 icon next to corpuses on the Saved (→ "Graph Votes") page
- **Keep:** Save button (▲) and Swap button (⇄) icons — these are simple and non-colorful

**Font Consistency — ensure EB Garamond everywhere:**
- Breadcrumb path concept names
- Flip View / Children View toggle button text
- Username and "Logout" text in the header
- "Login" / "Sign Up" text in the header (guest view)
- Parent concept names in children view (concept pane)
- Children concept names and child count in children view
- "No children yet" placeholder text (when a concept has no children)

**Color Removal — Zen style only (black on off-white):**
- Flip View / Children View toggle: remove green styling, use black text on off-white (with subtle distinction for active state, e.g., slightly darker background or underline — no color)
- Logout button: remove red color, use standard black text
- Save button active state: remove bright blue fill. Use a subtle visual difference (e.g., filled vs outlined, or slightly darker shade of the off-white background) instead of color. The unsaved state should still be visually distinct from saved, just not with bright color.

**Files likely changed:** `AppShell.jsx`, `Concept.jsx`, `ConceptGrid.jsx`, `FlipView.jsx`, `Root.jsx`, `CorpusTabContent.jsx`, `SavedPageOverlay.jsx`, `ConceptAnnotationPanel.jsx`

#### Phase 28b: UI Removals — Back Buttons, Ranking & Supergroups

**Remove Back Buttons:**
- Remove the ← back button from the breadcrumb path area (concept header)
- Remove the ← back button from Flip View
- Navigation still works via breadcrumb clicks, sidebar, and browser back — explicit back buttons are redundant

**Remove Ranking/Ordering Functionality:**
- Remove the ranking dropdown UI from ConceptGrid child cards (the "Rank: [—|1|2|...|N]" selector)
- Remove aggregated rank badges (#1: N, #2: N) from child cards
- Remove ranking-related sort logic from the vote set filter flow
- Remove or retire backend endpoints: `GET /votes/rankings`, `POST /votes/rankings/update`, `POST /votes/rankings/remove` (return 410 Gone, consistent with other retirements)
- Leave `child_rankings` table in database (append-only philosophy — don't drop tables)
- Remove ranking loading useEffect and state variables from `Concept.jsx`
- Remove ranking-related props passed to `ConceptGrid.jsx` and `VoteSetBar.jsx`
- Clean up the filter info text that references ranking ("rank your children with the dropdown", "sorted by community ranking")

**Remove Vote Set Supergroups (Layer 3):**
- Remove the super-group row above individual swatches in `VoteSetBar.jsx` (the 14px tall blended-color swatches that group similar vote sets)
- Remove the agglomerative clustering logic that computes super-groups (Jaccard threshold grouping)
- Remove super-group hover highlighting (glow + 1.3× scale on member dots)
- Remove super-group filtering logic from `getEffectiveActiveSetIndices()` — clicking a super-group swatch currently expands to all member sets
- Remove the sort toggle mode "Sort by Similarity" that cycles through similarity-based ordering in Flip View (if it interacts with super-groups)
- Keep individual vote set swatches (Layer 1) and tiered display (Layer 2) — only Layer 3 (super-groups) is removed
- No backend changes needed — super-groups are computed client-side from the existing `getVoteSets` response
- No tables to retire — super-groups have no database storage

**Files likely changed:** `Concept.jsx`, `ConceptGrid.jsx`, `FlipView.jsx`, `VoteSetBar.jsx`, `votesController.js`, `routes/votes.js`

#### Phase 28c: Rename & Title Changes

**Rename Saved Page to "Graph Votes":**
- Header button text: "Saved" → "Graph Votes"
- `SavedPageOverlay.jsx` title/header: "Saved" → "Graph Votes"
- Any references in the dormancy banner text ("dormant saved tab(s)" → "dormant Graph Votes tab(s)" or similar)
- Internal component names and file names can stay as-is (avoid unnecessary refactor churn)

**Browser Tab Title:**
- Change `<title>` in `index.html` from "concept hierarchy" (or whatever it currently says) to "orca"

**Files likely changed:** `AppShell.jsx`, `SavedPageOverlay.jsx`, `index.html`

#### Phase 28d: Bug Fixes

**Fix Decontextualized Document View Repeating Document:**
- Bug: The document body is rendered once per annotation, causing the full text to repeat multiple times
- Root cause: likely a `.map()` over annotations array that renders the document body inside each iteration instead of rendering the body once and the annotations separately
- Fix: Render document body once, then render annotation list separately below or alongside
- **File:** `DecontextualizedDocView.jsx`

**Fix Document Search in Add-Existing-Document:**
- Bug: Searching by document title when adding an existing document to a corpus only returns one result ("document2")
- Root cause: likely a query issue — possibly `LIMIT 1`, a missing `%` wildcard in the `LIKE`/`ILIKE` clause, or the search endpoint not using trigram/fuzzy matching for document titles
- Fix: Ensure the search query uses `ILIKE '%query%'` or similar and returns multiple results
- **Files:** `corpusController.js` (the endpoint that handles document search for add-existing), possibly `CorpusTabContent.jsx` or `CorpusDetailView.jsx` (whichever hosts the add-existing-document UI)

**Fix Missing Children View Button on Root Concept Flip View:**
- Bug: When viewing Flip View for a root concept, there is no button to switch back to Children View
- Root cause: the Children View toggle likely checks for a path/parent context and hides itself when path is empty (root concepts have empty paths)
- Fix: Show the toggle button for root concepts too — they have children and should be navigable in children view
- **File:** `Concept.jsx` (or wherever the view mode toggle renders)

**Fix Duplicate Document Tag "preprint" vs "Preprint":**
- Bug: Two rows exist in `document_tags` — one lowercase "preprint" and one capitalized "Preprint"
- Fix: Migration step in `migrate.js` to:
  1. Find the ID of the lowercase "preprint" tag (the keeper)
  2. Find the ID of the capitalized "Preprint" tag (the duplicate)
  3. Update any `documents.tag_id` pointing to the duplicate → point to the keeper
  4. Delete the duplicate row from `document_tags`
  5. Wrap in IF EXISTS checks for idempotency
- Also consider adding a UNIQUE index on `LOWER(name)` to prevent future case-insensitive duplicates (the current schema has `UNIQUE NOT NULL` on `name` but that's case-sensitive)
- **File:** `migrate.js`

#### Phase 28e: Corpus Member Visibility Update

**Allow All Members to See Other Members:**
- Current behavior: Non-owner corpus members see only a count ("N corpus members"). Only the owner sees the full member list with usernames.
- New behavior: ALL corpus members (owner AND allowed users) can see the full member list with usernames. Non-members still see count only. Owner retains the remove button; non-owner members see the list read-only (plus their own "Leave" button).
- Backend change: `GET /:corpusId/allowed-users` — currently returns full list only for corpus owner. Update to return full list for any user who is a corpus member (owner OR in `corpus_allowed_users`).
- Frontend change: The members panel in `CorpusTabContent.jsx` and `CorpusDetailView.jsx` already renders usernames when the backend provides them — the gating is on the backend response.

**Architecture Decision Updates:**
- Architecture Decision #39 updated in-place (see above)
- Architecture Decision #175 updated in-place (see above)

**Files likely changed:** `corpusController.js`, `CorpusTabContent.jsx`, `CorpusDetailView.jsx`

#### Phase 28f: Login Panel Redesign

**Convert Login from Standalone Page to Inline Modal:**
- Current: Login is a full separate page (`/login` route). Guest users leave whatever they're viewing to log in.
- New: Clicking "Login" in the header opens a dropdown/modal overlay on the current page. The modal has two tabs/toggles: "Login" and "Sign Up".
- Login tab: username + password fields + "Log in" button
- Sign Up tab: username + email + password fields + "Sign up" button
- Error messages displayed inline within the modal
- On successful login/register: modal closes, current page reloads with authenticated state (user's sidebar items load, guest restrictions lift)
- The `/login` and `/register` routes in `App.jsx` can remain as fallbacks (for direct URL access or invite acceptance flows that redirect to login), but the primary flow is now the modal
- Styling: EB Garamond font, black on off-white, consistent with Zen aesthetic. No colored buttons — use subtle borders/backgrounds.

**Files likely changed:** `AppShell.jsx` (new modal state + render), new `LoginModal.jsx` component (or inline in AppShell), `App.jsx` (keep routes as fallbacks)

#### Phase 28g: Expand Concept Name Character Limit

**Increase concept name limit from 40 → 255 characters:**
- With the [question] attribute, concepts like "How does institutional review board process design influence the reproducibility of findings across biomedical disciplines?" need room
- 255 characters is the classic VARCHAR default — generous enough for full research questions while still clearly a label, not a document

**Database migration (migrate.js):**
- `ALTER TABLE concepts ALTER COLUMN name TYPE VARCHAR(255)` — idempotent, PostgreSQL allows widening VARCHAR without data loss
- `ALTER TABLE document_concept_links_cache ALTER COLUMN concept_name TYPE VARCHAR(255)` — this cache table also stores concept names

**Backend changes:**
- `conceptsController.js`: Update the validation check from `name.length > 40` to `name.length > 255`
- Update any error message text referencing "40 characters"

**Frontend changes:**
- `SearchField.jsx`: Update `maxLength={40}` to `maxLength={255}` on the input element ✅
- Consider whether the search/create input field needs to be wider or allow wrapping for longer names
- Concept cards in `ConceptGrid.jsx` may need text wrapping or truncation for very long names — ensure they don't overflow their containers
- Breadcrumb path in `Concept.jsx` should handle long names gracefully (truncation with title tooltip, or wrapping)
- Flip View cards in `FlipView.jsx` — verify long concept names don't break card layout
- Root page cards in `Root.jsx` — same layout check

**Files likely changed:** `migrate.js`, `conceptsController.js`, `SearchField.jsx`, `ConceptGrid.jsx`, `Concept.jsx`, `FlipView.jsx`, `Root.jsx`

#### Implementation Order

28a → 28b → 28c → 28d → 28e → 28f → 28g

Each sub-phase should end with a clean build (`npm run build` passes with no errors) and a git commit before proceeding to the next.

#### Git Commits (Phase 28 — Suggested)
1. `feat: 28a, visual cleanup — remove icons, fix font consistency, remove button colors for Zen aesthetic`
2. `feat: 28b, remove back buttons, ranking/ordering, and vote set supergroups`
3. `feat: 28c, rename Saved page to Graph Votes, set browser tab title to orca`
4. `fix: 28d, bug fixes — decontextualized doc view repeat, document search, root flip view toggle, duplicate preprint tag`
5. `feat: 28e, allow all corpus members to view member usernames, update architecture decisions`
6. `feat: 28f, convert login from standalone page to inline modal with login/register tabs`
7. `feat: 28g, expand concept name character limit from 40 to 255`

#### Architecture Decisions (Phase 28)
- **Architecture Decision #186 — Icons Removed From UI Except Save/Swap:** Emoji icons (📚, 📌, 📋, 🏷) are removed from buttons and labels throughout the UI. Text labels replace them for clarity and consistency with the Zen aesthetic. The save (▲) and swap (⇄) buttons retain their simple non-emoji symbols as they're already minimal and widely understood.
- **Architecture Decision #187 — Ranking System and Vote Set Supergroups Retired:** The child ranking feature (Phase 5f) and vote set super-group similarity grouping (Phase 4, Layer 3) are both retired. Ranking endpoints return 410 Gone. The `child_rankings` table remains in the database (append-only philosophy). Ranking was designed for granular ordering within vote sets, but in practice the vote set swatch filtering provides sufficient signal. Super-groups (agglomerative clustering of similar vote sets into blended-color parent swatches) added visual complexity without proportionate insight — individual swatches with tiered display (Layer 2) are sufficient. Removing both simplifies the VoteSetBar and ConceptGrid UI significantly.
- **Architecture Decision #188 — Login Modal Replaces Login Page:** Guest users can log in or register via a modal overlay without leaving their current view. This is critical now that guest access is a primary entry path — users should be able to browse the graph and decide to log in without losing their place. The `/login` and `/register` routes remain as fallbacks for direct links and invite acceptance flows.
- **Architecture Decision #189 — Corpus Member Usernames Visible to All Members:** All corpus members (owner + allowed users) can see each other's usernames in the members panel. This relaxes the original design (Architecture Decision #39) where only the owner saw usernames. The change reflects that collaborative corpuses benefit from members knowing who else is participating. Non-members still see only a count. Graph-level voting (saves, swaps, links) remains anonymous. Updates Architecture Decisions #39 and #175.
- **Architecture Decision #190 — Saved Page Renamed to "Graph Votes":** The "Saved" page is renamed to "Graph Votes" to better communicate what it shows — the user's save votes organized by corpus. "Saved" was ambiguous (saved documents? saved searches?). "Graph Votes" directly describes the content: edges the user has voted to save in the concept graph.
- **Architecture Decision #191 — Concept Name Limit Expanded to 255 Characters:** The concept name character limit is raised from 40 to 255 to accommodate the [question] attribute. Research questions like "How does institutional review board process design influence the reproducibility of findings across biomedical disciplines?" easily exceed 40 characters. 255 is the classic VARCHAR default — generous enough for full research questions while clearly still a label, not a document. The limit is enforced at three levels: database column (`VARCHAR(255)`), backend validation, and frontend `maxLength`. The `document_concept_links_cache.concept_name` column is also widened to match.

### Phase 29: Web Link Comments, Top Annotation Sort & Flat Sort Selector (✅ COMPLETE)

Three features improving web link usability, concept child sorting, and sort UI visibility.

#### ✅ Completed (Phase 29a) — Web Link Creator Comments + Web Link UI Improvements

- **Schema changes (migrate.js):**
  - Added nullable `comment` TEXT column to `concept_links` table (idempotent ALTER TABLE)
  - Added `updated_at` TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP column to `concept_links` table (idempotent ALTER TABLE)

- **Backend changes (votesController.js):**
  - `getWebLinks`: Now returns `comment` and `updatedAt` for each link
  - `addWebLink`: Accepts optional `comment` field from request body, stores it on the new column
  - `getAllWebLinksForConcept`: Now returns `comment` and `updatedAt` for each link
  - New `updateConceptLinkComment`: PUT endpoint at `/web-links/:linkId/comment`. Auth required. Verifies creator (`added_by === userId`, returns 403 otherwise). Updates `comment` column. **Smart `updated_at` handling:** only updates `updated_at` if the link already had a comment — first-time comment additions leave `updated_at` unchanged so "(edited)" only appears for genuine modifications to an existing comment.

- **Route registration (votes.js):**
  - New route `PUT /web-links/:linkId/comment` with auth middleware

- **Frontend API (api.js):**
  - New method `updateLinkComment(linkId, comment)` calling the PUT endpoint

- **Frontend UI (ConceptAnnotationPanel.jsx — Web Links tab):**
  - Uses `useAuth()` to get current user ID for creator check
  - Displays comment below each web link in smaller font with creator username
  - Shows "(edited)" indicator when `updatedAt` differs from `createdAt`
  - Creator sees "Edit" text button (or "Add comment" if no comment exists); clicking opens inline textarea with Save/Cancel buttons
  - Non-creators see comment read-only with no edit button
  - Optimistic update on save with error rollback
  - **New "+ Add Web Link" button** at the top of the Web Links tab (only shown to logged-in users when a `currentEdgeId` exists). Opens inline form with URL input, optional title input, optional comment textarea, and Add/Cancel buttons. URL validation (must start with `http://` or `https://`), error display from backend (e.g., duplicate URL). On success, new link prepended to list and form closes.
  - **Clickable vote toggle:** The ↑ N vote count on each web link is now clickable. Toggles vote optimistically (calls `upvoteWebLink`/`removeWebLinkVote`). Voted state shows darker/bolder text. Guests get the login modal instead.
  - **Auto-resort on vote:** Web links re-sort by vote count after each vote toggle, keeping highest-voted links at the top.
  - All styled in EB Garamond, black-on-off-white Zen aesthetic

- Files changed: `migrate.js` (new columns), `votesController.js` (updated getWebLinks, addWebLink, getAllWebLinksForConcept + new updateConceptLinkComment), `votes.js` (new PUT route), `api.js` (new updateLinkComment method), `ConceptAnnotationPanel.jsx` (comment display, inline edit UI, add link form, clickable vote toggle, auto-resort)

#### ✅ Completed (Phase 29b) — "Top Annotation" Sort for Children

- **Backend changes (conceptsController.js):**
  - Both `getRootConcepts` and `getConceptWithChildren` now accept `sort=top_annotation` query parameter
  - Uses a `LEFT JOIN LATERAL` subquery that: finds all annotations on each edge via `document_annotations`, counts votes per annotation via `annotation_votes`, and takes the `MAX` vote count
  - Sorts descending by `top_annotation_votes`, with tiebreakers: save count descending, then concept name alphabetical
  - Returns `top_annotation_votes` in the response; edges with no annotations get 0 and sort to the bottom
  - Conditional join pattern matches the existing `sort=annotations` approach — no overhead on default queries

- **Frontend changes:**
  - `Concept.jsx` and `Root.jsx`: Added `'top_annotation'` to the sort options (initially added to dropdown, converted to flat row in 29c)
  - `ConceptGrid.jsx`: When `top_annotation_votes` is present and > 0 on a concept, displays a subtle "Top annotation: N votes" indicator below the child count

- Files changed: `conceptsController.js` (new sort parameter handling with LEFT JOIN LATERAL), `Concept.jsx`, `Root.jsx` (new sort option), `ConceptGrid.jsx` (top annotation votes indicator)

#### ✅ Completed (Phase 29c) — Flat Horizontal Sort Selector

- **UI change (Concept.jsx + Root.jsx):**
  - Replaced the `<select>` dropdown with a flat horizontal button row matching the `layerToggle` pattern from CorpusTabContent
  - Four options displayed inline: **Graph Votes | Newest | Annotations | Top Annotation**
  - Active state: `#333` background with white text; inactive: white background with `#888` text
  - `borderRight: 1px solid #eee` dividers between buttons, outer `border: 1px solid #ddd` with `borderRadius: 4px`
  - Removed old `sortSelect` and `sortSelectActive` styles, added `sortRow`, `sortBtn`, `sortBtnActive`
  - Identical markup and styling in both `Root.jsx` and `Concept.jsx`

- Files changed: `Concept.jsx`, `Root.jsx` (replaced select dropdown with flat toggle row + matching styles)

#### Architecture Decisions (Phase 29)

- **Architecture Decision #192 — Web Link Comments Are Editable by Creator:** Web link comments are the one exception to Orca's immutability philosophy. Unlike document annotations (which reference immutable document content), web link comments describe external URLs whose destinations can genuinely change over time. Allowing the creator to update their comment ensures the context remains accurate as external content evolves. The `updated_at` timestamp and "(edited)" indicator maintain transparency — users can see that a comment was modified. Only the original link creator can edit; other users see the comment read-only. First-time comment additions do NOT trigger "(edited)" — only subsequent modifications do. This follows the same creator-only pattern used for link removal (Phase 6).

- **Architecture Decision #193 — Top Annotation Sort Uses MAX Single Annotation Votes:** The "Top Annotation" sort orders children by the highest vote count on any single annotation for that concept, not by total votes across all annotations or by annotation count. This provides a quality signal: which concepts have annotations the community found most valuable? The existing "Annotations" sort (Phase 11) provides the complementary breadth signal (most distinct annotated documents). Together they let users find concepts that are either widely annotated (breadth) or deeply endorsed (quality). The MAX approach avoids favoring concepts that simply have many mediocre annotations.

- **Architecture Decision #194 — Flat Horizontal Sort Selector Replaces Dropdown:** The `<select>` dropdown for children sort is replaced with a flat horizontal toggle row matching the annotation filter style (All | Corpus Members | Author). Dropdown menus hide options; a flat row makes all sort options immediately visible and discoverable. The four options (Graph Votes, Newest, Annotations, Top Annotation) fit comfortably on one line. This follows the principle that key navigation controls should be visible, not buried in menus.

- **Architecture Decision #195 — Inline Web Link Creation in Annotation Panel:** The "+ Add Web Link" form is embedded inline in the Web Links tab of the ConceptAnnotationPanel, rather than in a modal or separate page. This keeps web link management co-located with web link viewing, consistent with how annotation creation works inline in corpus tabs. The form only appears when logged in and when a `currentEdgeId` exists (web links are edge-scoped).

- **Architecture Decision #196 — Clickable Web Link Vote Toggle with Auto-Resort:** Web link vote counts are clickable to toggle the user's vote (previously vote toggling may have required a separate button). After each vote toggle, the link list re-sorts by vote count to maintain vote-descending order. This gives users immediate visual feedback that their vote affected the ranking. Guests clicking the vote count are shown the login modal.

### Phase 30: Pre-Launch Bug Fixes & Enhancements (✅ COMPLETE)

Batch of cleanup items, bug fixes, and small features addressed before public launch. Phase 30i (duplicate search results) was skipped — bug could not be reproduced.

#### ✅ Completed (Phase 30b) — Fix "Active Users" Text
- `Root.jsx`: Changed `{totalUsers} active {totalUsers === 1 ? 'user' : 'users'}` to `{totalUsers} {totalUsers === 1 ? 'user' : 'users'}`
- Files changed: `Root.jsx`

#### ✅ Completed (Phase 30e) — Fix "Allowed User" Badge to "Member"
- `CorpusTabContent.jsx`: Changed badge text from "allowed user" to "Member" for non-owner corpus members. Also capitalized "Owner" badge to match.
- Files changed: `CorpusTabContent.jsx`

#### ✅ Completed (Phase 30f) — Browser Title Safeguard
- `index.html`: Verified `<title>` tag already says "orca"
- `AppShell.jsx`: Added `document.title = 'orca';` at the top of the mount useEffect to prevent any title reversion
- Files changed: `AppShell.jsx`

#### ✅ Completed (Phase 30h) — Remove Children View Button from Decontextualized Flip View
- `Concept.jsx`: Wrapped the flip/children view toggle button with `{!isDecontextualized && (...)}` so it doesn't render in decontextualized flip view (search-originated, no path context)
- Added `userToggledFlip` ref to distinguish between "user manually clicked flip toggle" and "concept opened in decontextualized flip view from search" — the button stays hidden only when the concept was opened decontextualized, but reappears if a root concept was manually flipped
- Files changed: `Concept.jsx`

#### ✅ Completed (Phase 30k) — Change Flag-to-Hide Threshold to 10
- `moderationController.js`: Flag endpoint now only sets `is_hidden = true` when `COUNT(*) >= 10` on `concept_flags` for that edge (was immediate hide on single flag)
- **New unflag endpoint:** `POST /api/moderation/unflag` — allows a user to remove their own flag from an edge. Added to `moderationController.js` and `moderation.js` routes.
- `conceptsController.js`: Added `flag_count` and `user_flagged` subqueries to both `getRootConcepts` and `getConceptWithChildren` so the frontend can display flag status per concept
- **Frontend flag count display:** `ConceptGrid.jsx` shows "X user(s) have flagged this as spam" in red text for concepts with 1–9 flags. Concepts with 0 flags show nothing; 10+ are hidden.
- **Unflag context menu:** `ConceptGrid.jsx` right-click context menu shows "Unflag as spam" when the current user has already flagged a concept, "Flag as spam" otherwise
- `Root.jsx` and `Concept.jsx`: Updated flag confirmation dialogs from "This will immediately hide it from all users" to "Once 10 users have flagged it, it will be hidden from all users". Added `handleUnflag` handlers passed to both ConceptGrid instances.
- `api.js`: Added `moderationAPI.unflagEdge(edgeId)` method
- Files changed: `moderationController.js`, `moderation.js`, `conceptsController.js`, `ConceptGrid.jsx`, `Concept.jsx`, `Root.jsx`, `api.js`

#### ✅ Completed (Phase 30a) — Remove Dormant Tab Functionality
- **Backend (`conceptsController.js`):** Removed `DORMANT_USERS_SUBQUERY` constant and all 8 usages of `AND v.user_id NOT IN (${DORMANT_USERS_SUBQUERY})` from vote counting queries. Removed `FILTER (WHERE v.user_id NOT IN ...)` from diff query. Vote counts now include ALL users with no dormancy filtering.
- **Backend (`votesController.js`):** Removed `DORMANT_USERS_SUBQUERY` constant and all usages. Replaced `recordTabActivity`, `getTabActivity`, and `reviveTabActivity` with 410 Gone stubs.
- **Frontend (`AppShell.jsx`):** Removed `dormantTabCount` and `showDormancyBanner` state, the useEffect that fetched tab activity on mount, and the amber dormancy warning banner JSX + styles.
- **Frontend (`SavedPageOverlay.jsx`):** Removed all dormancy state (`tabActivity`, `dormancyModal`, `reviving`, `viewingDormant`), removed `recordActivity`/`handleRevive`/`handleViewWithoutReviving` functions, removed dormant tab styling/badge/info bar/all-dormant message/revival modal, removed ~12 dormancy-related styles. Simplified tab click to `setActiveTabKey`.
- **Frontend (`api.js`):** Removed `getTabActivity`, `recordTabActivity`, `reviveTabActivity` methods.
- Database tables and `migrate.js` left untouched per append-only policy.
- Build ~6KB smaller after removal.
- Files changed: `conceptsController.js`, `votesController.js`, `AppShell.jsx`, `SavedPageOverlay.jsx`, `api.js`

#### ✅ Completed (Phase 30d) — Flip View Vote Display Overhaul
- `FlipView.jsx`: Replaced "Link" text button and "Linked" badge with ▲ triangle vote button styled to match ConceptGrid's save vote buttons
- **Unvoted state:** Light gray background, tooltip "Vote this context as helpful"
- **Voted state:** Dark filled background, no tooltip
- **Guest state:** Dimmed non-clickable button with "Log in to vote on links" tooltip
- Only renders in contextual flip view (the `isContextual &&` guard was already in place)
- Each card now shows: existing save count (▲ {vote_count}) in the parent row, plus the link vote triangle (▲ {link_count}) in the bottom row alongside similarity percentage
- Removed styles: `linkSection`, `linkButton`, `linkButtonActive`, `linkedBadge`
- Files changed: `FlipView.jsx`

#### ✅ Completed (Phase 30j) — Remove Vote Set Drift + Sort Swatches by Similarity

**Part 1 — Drift removal:**
- `VoteSetBar.jsx`: Removed `driftData` prop, `hoveredSwatchIndex` state, `renderDriftPopover()`, `swatchHoverProps()`, and all drift styles
- `Concept.jsx`: Removed `driftData` state, `loadDriftData()` function, and drift prop passing to VoteSetBar
- `votesController.js`: `getVoteSetDrift` returns 410 Gone. Removed all 3 `INSERT INTO vote_set_changes` statements and their associated `parentEdgeMap`/`swapParentEdgeMap` lookups from `addVote`, `removeVote`, and `addSwapVote`
- `api.js`: Removed `getVoteSetDrift` method
- `vote_set_changes` table left in database (append-only philosophy)

**Part 2 — Jaccard similarity sorting:**
- `conceptsController.js` (`getVoteSets`): After computing vote sets, reorders them using nearest-neighbor with Jaccard similarity. Starts with the largest set (first from `ORDER BY user_count DESC`), then greedily picks the most similar unplaced set. `setIndex` values and `edgeToSets` mapping are rebuilt after reordering.
- Effect: Vote sets with similar child compositions get adjacent swatches and therefore adjacent colors from the palette, making visual patterns more meaningful.

- Files changed: `VoteSetBar.jsx`, `Concept.jsx`, `votesController.js`, `conceptsController.js`, `api.js`

#### ✅ Completed (Phase 30c) — Fix Browser Back Button Navigation

**Implementation in `AppShell.jsx`:**
- Added `popstateInProgressRef` + `activeTabRef` refs to prevent infinite loops and access current active tab in the popstate event listener
- New `buildGraphTabUrl()` helper builds URL with query params (`?gtab=5&c=123&p=1,2&v=flip`)
- Popstate listener (`window.addEventListener('popstate', ...)`) on browser back/forward: reads stored state, switches to the correct tab, updates the graph tab's concept/path/viewMode, persists to DB, and sets `document.title = 'orca'`
- Initial history seed: `replaceState` on first load so there's a base entry to return to
- Modified `handleGraphTabNavigate`: after updating state, if it's a navigation change (not label-only) and not from a popstate, calls `pushState` with merged tab state
- Tab switching does NOT push history (only in-tab navigation does)
- Label-only updates (concept name loading) do NOT push history
- Flip view toggle is included in history (`&v=flip` in URL)
- Guest mode works for navigation but skips DB persistence

**Implementation in `Concept.jsx`:**
- Expanded sync effect: now watches `initialConceptId`, serialized `initialPath`, and `initialViewMode` instead of just `initialConceptId`, so popstate-driven path/viewMode changes are properly synced to internal state

- Files changed: `AppShell.jsx`, `Concept.jsx`

#### ✅ Completed (Phase 30g) — Informational Pages with Comment System

**Backend:**
- `migrate.js`: Added `page_comments` table (with nullable `parent_comment_id` self-referencing FK with `ON DELETE CASCADE` for replies) and `page_comment_votes` table with indexes
- New `pagesController.js` with three endpoints:
  - `getPageComments`: Validates slug ('using-orca', 'constitution', 'donate'), joins with users for username, counts votes, includes `userVoted` for authenticated users, sorted by `vote_count DESC` then `created_at DESC`. Fetches all comments in one query, then builds tree in JS: top-level comments with `replies[]` arrays sorted by votes.
  - `addPageComment`: Validates slug + body (non-empty, max 2000 chars), accepts optional `parentCommentId` (validates parent exists on same slug and is top-level — returns 400 "Cannot reply to a reply" if parent is itself a reply), inserts comment, auto-votes for creator
  - `togglePageCommentVote`: Checks existing vote — if exists DELETE, if not INSERT. Returns new voted state and count. Works for both top-level comments and replies.
- New `routes/pages.js`: `GET /:slug/comments` (optionalAuth), `POST /:slug/comments` (auth), `POST /comments/:commentId/vote` (auth)
- `server.js`: Mounted at `app.use('/api/pages', pageRoutes)`
- `api.js`: Added `pagesAPI` with `getComments(slug)`, `addComment(slug, body, parentCommentId)`, `toggleCommentVote(commentId)`

**Frontend:**
- New `InfoPage.jsx` component:
  - Renders page title based on slug ("Using Orca", "Constitution", "Donate")
  - Placeholder body text: "This page is under construction. Content coming soon."
  - Community Comments section with:
    - Textarea + "Add Comment" button for logged-in users
    - Vote toggles (filled ▲ / unfilled △) on each comment
    - Relative timestamps (just now, 5m ago, 2h ago, 3d ago, etc.)
    - "Log in to add comments and vote" note for guests
    - Optimistic vote updates with rollback on error
  - **Comment replies (1 level deep):**
    - Top-level comments show a "Reply" toggle button (logged-in only)
    - Clicking "Reply" opens inline textarea + Reply/Cancel buttons below the comment
    - Replies render indented (40px left margin) with subtle 2px solid #eee left border
    - Replies have vote toggles but no "Reply" button (enforcing 1-level max depth)
    - Replies sorted by vote count descending within each parent
    - Vote toggle searches both top-level and nested replies via recursive `toggleVoteInList` helper
  - Styled in EB Garamond, black on off-white (#faf9f7), neutral border buttons

- `AppShell.jsx` header dropdown:
  - Small ▾ arrow next to "orca" title opens dropdown with "Using Orca", "Constitution", "Donate"
  - Click-outside closes dropdown
  - Clicking a link navigates to the route and closes dropdown
  - Clicking "orca" while on an info page navigates back to /
  - When on an info page route (`/using-orca`, `/constitution`, `/donate`), the normal sidebar + tab content is replaced with InfoPage
  - Routing handled via `useLocation` in AppShell (no changes to App.jsx needed)
  - Both logged-in users and guests can access all three pages

- Files changed: `migrate.js`, new `pagesController.js`, new `routes/pages.js`, `server.js`, `api.js`, new `InfoPage.jsx`, `AppShell.jsx`

**Updated `page_comments` schema (with replies):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE page_comments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  page_slug VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  parent_comment_id INTEGER REFERENCES page_comments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
CREATE INDEX idx_page_comments_page ON page_comments(page_slug);

CREATE TABLE page_comment_votes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  comment_id INTEGER REFERENCES page_comments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, comment_id)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_page_comment_votes_comment ON page_comment_votes(comment_id);
```

**New backend endpoints (`/api/pages`):**

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/:slug/comments` | Guest OK | Get all comments for a page with nested replies, sorted by vote count desc. Returns `user_voted` for logged-in users. |
| POST | `/:slug/comments` | Required | Add a comment or reply. Body: `{ body, parentCommentId? }`. Max 2000 chars. Replies must target a top-level comment on the same slug. |
| POST | `/comments/:commentId/vote` | Required | Toggle vote on a comment or reply (insert if not voted, delete if already voted). |

#### Phase 30i: Duplicate Search Results — ⏭ SKIPPED
Bug could not be reproduced. No changes made.

#### Architecture Decisions (Phase 30)

- **Architecture Decision #197 — Dormant Tab Functionality Removed:** The dormancy tracking system (Phase 8) is removed from the active codebase. The feature added complexity (background jobs, conditional vote exclusion across 13+ queries, revival modals, dormancy banners) without proportionate value at launch scale. The `saved_page_tab_activity` table remains in the database. If vote hygiene becomes important at scale, a simpler mechanism (e.g., account-level inactivity rather than per-tab tracking) can be designed with real user data.

- **Architecture Decision #198 — Link Votes Use Same Triangle Icon as Save Votes:** Flip View link votes are restyled to use the same ▲ triangle icon as save votes, replacing the previous "Linked" badge. This creates visual consistency across the two vote types that appear on Flip View cards. The filled/unfilled state communicates voted/not-voted without needing a separate badge. Tooltip on unvoted: "Vote this context as helpful"; no tooltip when voted. Guest users see a dimmed non-clickable button with "Log in to vote on links" tooltip.

- **Architecture Decision #199 — Informational Pages with Community Comments and Replies:** Static informational pages (Using Orca, Constitution, Donate) include a community comment system with one level of threaded replies. This aligns with Orca's philosophy of productive contestation — even meta-level pages about the platform itself benefit from community input. Comments and replies are vote-sorted (same pattern as annotations) and permanent (no deletion, consistent with append-only philosophy). Replies are limited to one level deep — cannot reply to a reply. The `parent_comment_id` column on `page_comments` is nullable (NULL for top-level, FK to parent for replies). Backend validates reply depth and same-slug constraint.

- **Architecture Decision #200 — Vote Set Drift Tracking Removed:** The vote set drift feature (Phase 23) is removed from the active codebase. The hover popover showing "where former set-mates migrated to" added UI complexity (popover positioning, swatch matching, departure rendering) without clear user value at launch scale. The `vote_set_changes` table remains in the database. Event logging into the table is also removed since drift was the only consumer.

- **Architecture Decision #201 — Vote Set Swatches Sorted by Compositional Similarity:** Vote set swatches are reordered so that sets with similar child compositions (high Jaccard similarity on voted-for child edge IDs) are placed adjacent to each other. This uses nearest-neighbor ordering: start with the largest set, then always place the most similar unplaced set next. The result is that users who saved similar subsets of children get adjacent colored swatches, making visual patterns in the swatch bar more meaningful. Colors are still assigned by index position from the static 12-color palette — the palette order is unchanged, but since sets are now sorted by similarity, adjacent sets naturally get adjacent colors.

- **Architecture Decision #202 — Flag-to-Hide Threshold Raised to 10:** The single-flag-hides model (Phase 16) was designed for early development when any spam needed immediate removal. With real users, a single flag is too aggressive — it allows any user to unilaterally hide content. Raising to 10 flags requires community consensus before content is hidden. Admin unhide remains available for false positives. The threshold can be adjusted via future configuration if needed.

- **Architecture Decision #203 — Unflag Endpoint for Flag Reversal:** Users can remove their own flag from a concept via `POST /api/moderation/unflag`. The context menu on concept cards dynamically shows "Flag as spam" or "Unflag as spam" based on the `user_flagged` boolean returned in children queries. This prevents users from being permanently committed to a flag they may have cast by mistake.

- **Architecture Decision #204 — Flag Count Visible on Concept Cards Below Threshold:** Concepts with 1–9 flags (below the hide threshold) display a red "X user(s) have flagged this as spam" indicator on their cards. This provides transparency about community sentiment before the hide threshold is reached. Concepts with 0 flags show nothing; concepts with 10+ flags are hidden and appear in the HiddenConceptsView.

- **Architecture Decision #205 — Browser History Integration for Graph Tab Navigation:** In-tab concept navigation now pushes entries to the browser history via `window.history.pushState`. URL query parameters (`?gtab=`, `&c=`, `&p=`, `&v=`) encode the active graph tab, concept, path, and view mode. A `popstate` listener handles browser back/forward by restoring the graph tab state from the history entry. Tab switching does NOT push history — only in-tab navigation does. This resolves the longstanding issue where browser back/forward buttons were non-functional during graph exploration.

- **Architecture Decision #206 — Phone OTP Authentication Replaces Email + Password (Phase 32):** Phone OTP authentication replaces email + password. Motivation: vote integrity (phone numbers harder to multiply than emails) + reduced data exposure (only bcrypt-hashed phones stored, no plaintext). Twilio Verify API handles OTP delivery — no codes stored in Orca's database. Rate limiting: 5 requests per IP per 15 minutes on /send-code. JWT extended to 90d (reduces OTP frequency; Orca's threat model doesn't require short-lived tokens). `token_issued_after` column enables 'Log out everywhere' as safety net for long-lived tokens. `email` and `password_hash` columns retained but functionally retired (append-only philosophy).

- **Architecture Decision #207 — HMAC Phone Lookup Replaces O(n) Bcrypt Scan (Phase 33e):** Login and registration previously fetched ALL user rows and ran `bcrypt.compare()` against each phone hash — O(n) scaling that would time out at ~10,000 users. Fixed by adding a `phone_lookup` column storing HMAC-SHA256 of the normalized phone number (keyed by `PHONE_LOOKUP_KEY` env var). HMAC is deterministic (same input + same key = same output), so it can be indexed with a UNIQUE constraint and queried in O(1). The bcrypt `phone_hash` column is retained (append-only philosophy) but no longer used for lookup. Security tradeoff: HMAC is weaker than bcrypt against brute-force (no salt rounds), but phone numbers are already partially public identifiers — the HMAC prevents reverse lookup without the server key, and the UNIQUE constraint replaces the bcrypt-based uniqueness check.

### Future Considerations

- **Robust Similar-Results Functionality**
  - Applied broadly whenever net new concepts or attribute tags are being added
  - Prevents proliferation of near-duplicate entries

- **Community-Threshold Unhiding**
  - Phase 16 ships with admin-only unhide. Future enhancement: if show votes exceed hide votes by a configurable threshold, auto-unhide. Requires careful design to prevent vote-brigading on moderation decisions.

- **Attribute Governance**
  - The original Phase 23 (user-generated attributes) was cancelled. The owner will manually add new attributes as needed. Future enhancement if user-generated attributes are ever opened: admin approval for new attributes, community proposal process, or attribute merge/alias tools to consolidate near-duplicates (e.g., merging "instrument" and "instruments" into a single attribute).

---

## Data Model Concepts

### Graphs vs Concepts vs Edges

**Graphs:**
- Not stored as explicit entities
- Implicitly defined by unique root concepts
- Identified by the path of concept IDs
- Example: `[1, 2, 3]` represents one graph path

**Concepts:**
- Globally unique by name
- **255-character maximum** for concept names (raised from 40 in Phase 28g)
- Can appear in many graphs
- Can have different children in different contexts

**Edges:**
- Define parent-child relationships
- Context-specific (tied to a graph path)
- Multiple edges can exist for same parent-child pair in different contexts
- Carry a required attribute tag (Phase 3)

**Attributes:**
- Discrete, reusable category labels — NOT key-value metadata pairs
- Three default/seeded attributes: **action**, **tool**, **value**. A fourth attribute, **question**, has been added for research questions. All four are enabled at launch via `ENABLED_ATTRIBUTES=value,action,tool,question`. The owner will manually add new attributes as needed (identity-defining, same mechanics as the defaults).
- Applied to edges at creation time and immutable thereafter
- Same concept can carry different attributes in different contexts
- A concept with multiple attributes in the same context appears as multiple separate entries
- Same concept name + different attribute = completely separate contextual entities (independent saves, children, paths)
- **Required:** Every concept must have an attribute. No unattributed concepts.
- **Display:** Always shown in square brackets: `Concept Name [attribute]`

**Example:**
```
Concept "Microscopy" (ID: 5) appears in:

Graph 1: Methods(1) → Microscopy [tool](5)
  - graph_path: [1]
  - children: Fluorescence [tool], Electron [tool]

Graph 2: Cell Biology(2) → Microscopy [tool](5)
  - graph_path: [2]
  - children: Confocal [tool], Live Imaging [action]

Same concept, different contexts, different children.
```

**Attribute Example:**
```
In path: Research Design(1) → Experiment Planning [action](2)

Children:
  - Hypothesis Generation [action]  ← edge has attribute_id pointing to "action"
  - Statistical Software [tool]     ← edge has attribute_id pointing to "tool"
  - Reproducibility [value]         ← edge has attribute_id pointing to "value"

These display as separate entries. Each can have its own children,
save counts, and branching paths. The hierarchical relationship
represents the order in which these things are thought about
during real decision making.
```

### Vote Types

| Type | Short Name | Purpose | Scope | Destination Required |
|------|------------|---------|-------|---------------------|
| Save | Save | Endorse a concept in context; saves full path to Saved Page | Full path (max 1 per user per edge) | No |
| ~~Move~~ | ~~Move~~ | ~~Assert concept belongs elsewhere~~ | ~~Single edge~~ | ~~Yes — user specifies destination context~~ |
| Swap | Swap | Assert concept should be replaced by a sibling | Single edge | Yes — user specifies sibling |
| Link | Link | Assert a parent context is helpful relative to origin context | Contextual Flip View only | No — applied to existing parent context |

### Flip View Modes

| Mode | Entry Point | Primary Sort | Secondary Sort (Tiebreaker) | Link Votes | Use Case |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------------------------|------------|----------|
| Contextual | Click flip button from a concept in a specific path | Link vote count (descending) | Save count of concept in each parent context (hidden — not displayed) | Yes — users can link a parent context as helpful relative to origin | Exploring alternate paths for a concept you're already viewing |
| Decontextualized | Select a concept from search | By save count (most saves first) | N/A | No | General exploration of where a concept appears |

**Flip View Card Layout:** Parent contexts are displayed as a flat grid of cards. In contextual mode, cards are sorted by link vote count descending, with save count as a hidden tiebreaker for ties (including all cards with 0 link votes). In decontextualized mode, cards are sorted by save count descending. Each card shows the full ancestor path above the immediate parent (smaller text) and the parent name (larger black text).

## Notes for Future Claude Sessions

### When Starting a New Session

Provide this context:
1. "We're building Orca - a collaborative action ontology platform"
2. Current phase (e.g., "Phase 4 complete, next up: Phase 5 — Saved Page")
3. Today's goal (e.g., "Implement swap votes")
4. Relevant files (upload if making changes)

### Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Public/Collaborative:** All graphs are public, no user ownership
2. **Context-Dependent Identity:** Path + attribute = unique contextual identity. Same concept name in different paths = completely different entities with independent save counts, children, and attributes.
3. **Graph Path Array:** PostgreSQL array stores full path from root
4. **Concept Reuse:** Creating concepts checks for existing names first
5. **Concept Name Limit:** 255 characters maximum for concept names (raised from 40 in Phase 28g to support research questions). Enforced at frontend (`maxLength={255}` on SearchField and AnnotationPanel concept search inputs), backend (application-level check `> 255`), and database level (`VARCHAR(255)` on `concepts.name` and `document_concept_links_cache.concept_name`).
6. **Append-Only / Never Delete:** No deletion of concepts or edges. Content is only hidden (for spam/abuse), never removed. Hidden items retain talk pages for accountability. Low-saved content stays visible — hiding and voting are completely separate systems.
7. **bcryptjs:** Using bcryptjs instead of bcrypt for ARM64 compatibility
8. **Attributes on Edges (Single-Attribute Graphs, Phase 20a):** Every graph has exactly one attribute, determined by the root edge's `attribute_id`. All descendant edges must match. `attribute_id` is stored on every edge (redundant but avoids root-edge joins). Consistency enforced at write time — backend looks up `graph_path[0]` to find the root edge's attribute. Users select an attribute only when creating root concepts; child creation auto-inherits.
9. **Attributes Are Required at Root Creation:** Every root concept must have one of the four released attributes (action, tool, value, question) selected at creation time. Children inherit the graph's attribute automatically.
10. **Four Released Attributes — All Enabled at Launch:** Four attributes exist in the database (`action`, `tool`, `value`, `question`) and all four are enabled at launch. The owner controls which attributes are available via the `ENABLED_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable. No user-created attributes.
11. **Attribute Display Format (Phase 20a):** Bracket tags (`[attribute]`) removed from all concept name displays. Attribute badges now appear only in: concept page header, root page cards, Flip View cards (one per card), and annotation cards.
12. **Full-Path Saves:** Saving a concept saves the entire path above it. Save count on any edge = number of distinct users who have that edge in their saved tree. Max 1 save per user per edge — no double counting across branches. Totals always reflect what users see on their Saved Pages.
13. **Three Vote Types (Phase 20b):** Save, Swap, and Link — each serves a distinct organizational purpose. All are visible signals, not automated actions. Move votes were removed in Phase 20b (redundant with link votes). Database tables retain original names (`votes`, `replace_votes`, `similarity_votes`) while UI uses short names. Save and swap are mutually exclusive per user per edge (Phase 20c).
14. **Inactive Saved Tab Dormancy:** Save totals and vote set calculations exclude votes linked to dormant saved tabs (tabs not opened for 30+ days). Only save votes are affected — swap and link votes are independent of saved tabs. Dormant votes are restored immediately when the user opens the tab and chooses to revive. A vote linked to multiple tabs goes dormant only when ALL its linked tabs are dormant. (✅ IMPLEMENTED — Phase 8) **❌ REMOVED in Phase 30a** — feature retired for launch simplification. Vote counts now include all users unconditionally.
15. **Root Edges for Unified Saving:** Root concepts have edges with `parent_id = NULL` and `graph_path = '{}'` so that all saving goes through the edge model. This avoids a separate saving mechanism for roots.
16. **Flip View State in URL:** Flip View toggle is stored as a `&view=flip` query parameter rather than React state, so browser back/forward buttons work naturally with view mode changes.
17. **Flip View Sorting (Contextual):** Primary sort by link vote count descending. Tiebreaker: save count of concept in that parent context (hidden — not displayed on cards). This ensures Flip View is useful even with zero link votes.
18. **Hidden Namespace Blocking:** If a concept is hidden in a specific path + attribute context, that namespace is blocked — cannot recreate an identically-named concept with the same attribute in that path until unhidden.
19. **pg_trgm for Fuzzy Search:** Using PostgreSQL's pg_trgm extension for concept name search. Provides trigram similarity matching (handles typos, partial matches) with no external dependencies. Plan to add pgvector-based embedding search later for true semantic matching (e.g., "jogging" → "running") when the concept corpus is large enough to justify it.
20. **Unified Add/Search Field:** The SearchField component replaces separate "Add" buttons on both Root and Concept pages. Adding concepts and searching are combined into a single input field. On concept pages, "Add as child" appears in the search dropdown. On the root page, "Create as root concept" appears instead. Search results always navigate to decontextualized Flip View.
21. **Decontextualized Flip View Detection:** A concept page is in decontextualized Flip View when the URL has `view=flip` but no `path` parameter — meaning the user arrived via search, not by navigating the graph. In this mode: no breadcrumb, no Children View toggle, no search field, and FlipView receives `mode="exploratory"`. The Back button (`navigate(-1)`) is the only navigation. This detection pattern (`const isDecontextualized = viewMode === 'flip' && !hasPath`) should be reused wherever contextual vs decontextualized behavior diverges.
22. **Saved Tree Reordering:** Within each saved tab, users can reorder root-level graph trees via up/down arrow buttons on each tree card. Order persists between sessions via the `saved_tree_order` database table. Each saved tab has its own independent ordering. Trees without an explicit order record fall to the bottom, sorted by save count. Uses optimistic state updates with DB persistence via upsert.
23. **Sort by New:** Secondary sort option on Root and Concept pages. Default is always sort by saves. "Sort by New" sorts by edge creation timestamp (newest first) for ad hoc discovery.
24. **"Link" Terminology Scope:** "Link" refers to the vote type used in Flip View (formerly "similarity vote"). External URLs attached to concepts are called "external links" to avoid confusion.
25. **Unsave Cascading:** Unsaving a concept (in children view or via X button on Saved page) cascades to all descendants in that branch. Save counts on all affected edges are subtracted accordingly. Uses PostgreSQL array prefix matching to find descendant edges.
26. **In-App Tab System:** Orca uses in-app tabs (within one browser tab) for both concept navigation panes and Saved page tabs. Users can have multiple concept panes open in different graph areas, duplicate tabs to branch navigation, and maintain multiple named Saved tabs. Right-click any tab to open in a new browser tab/window.
27. **Saved Tab Selection on Save:** When saving a concept, the user selects which Saved tab to save it to. One tab per save action (can repeat for additional tabs). A default "Saved" tab is auto-created per user.
28. **Vote-Tab Junction Table Model:** Votes remain unique per `(user_id, edge_id)` — a vote is a user's endorsement of an edge. The `vote_tab_links` junction table maps votes to tabs (many-to-many). This means tabs are purely organizational and don't affect save counts visible to other users. Deleting a tab removes links; votes that lose their last link are cleaned up. This is preferred over adding `saved_tab_id` to the votes table (which would require duplicate vote rows per tab and complicate count queries).
29. **Tab-Scoped Unsave:** Unsaving from the Saved Page uses `removeVoteFromTab` which removes the vote-tab link for that tab and cascades to descendants. If the vote has no remaining tab links, the vote itself is deleted. This differs from `removeVote` (used in children view) which deletes the vote entirely regardless of tabs.
28. **Saved Page Tree Building:** The Saved Page backend returns a flat list of all edges the user has saved. The frontend builds trees client-side by: (1) separating root edges (parentId === null) from non-root edges, (2) building a childrenMap keyed by "parentId-graphPath" to find children of any node, (3) recursively assembling trees from each root edge. This avoids complex recursive SQL and keeps the backend query simple.
28. **Flip View Similarity Percentage:** In contextual Flip View, each alt parent card displays a Jaccard similarity score: `shared direct children / total unique direct children across both contexts`. Sortable ascending or descending. Does not recurse into subchildren.
29. **Vote Set Threshold Removed (Phase 5f):** Vote sets originally required a minimum of 2 users sharing the exact same saved children set to get a color swatch. This was removed in Phase 5f so that solo users (1 person who saved a unique set of children) also get a swatch. This is necessary for child ranking — users need to see their own swatch to rank their children even before anyone else joins their set. The `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2` clause was removed from the `getVoteSets` SQL query.
30. **Vote Set Color Palette:** A curated 12-color named palette (Indigo, Teal, Crimson, Goldenrod, Forest, Coral, Slate, Sienna, Plum, Steel, Olive, Rose) is the sole source of color in the UI. Colors cycle if more than 12 sets exist. Color assignment is index-based (deterministic per page load, but not persisted across sessions — this is acceptable for now and will be addressed when similarity grouping adds color stability requirements).
31. **Sort by Annotation Count (Future):** Child concepts can be sorted by how many corpus documents contain them as annotations. This sort option becomes available after Phase 7 (corpus/annotation infrastructure). Complements existing sort-by-saves and sort-by-new options.
32. **Vote Set Similarity Grouping — 💤 RETIRED (Phase 28b):** Similar-but-not-identical vote sets were grouped into super-groups using agglomerative hierarchical clustering. **Super-group UI and computation were removed in Phase 28b.** Individual vote set swatches and filtering remain. The original design: average-link similarity (deterministic, not random), threshold 50% Jaccard overlap on edge IDs, super-group swatches (14px tall, blended color) above component swatches in a two-row layout, hover highlighting, unified `getEffectiveActiveSetIndices()` function. Group assignments were recomputed on each votesets request.
33. **Tab Grouping (Flat Only):** Tabs of any type (Saved, graph pane, corpus) can be grouped into named tab groups. Groups appear as expandable headers in the tab bar — click to expand/collapse. One level of nesting only — no groups within groups. Mixed tab types allowed within a single group. Group membership managed via right-click context menus (create group, add to group, remove from group). Expand/collapse state and group membership persisted server-side via `tab_groups` table + `group_id` FK on `saved_tabs`, `graph_tabs`, and `corpus_subscriptions` (Phase 7f). Deleting a group ungroups its tabs (sets `group_id = NULL`), does not delete them.
34. **Documents Are Always Editable by Original Uploader (Phase 21a):** Documents can be edited at any time by their original uploader. Annotation offsets are adjusted via `diff-match-patch` on save. The previous immutability model (draft/finalize with `is_draft` column) was removed in Phase 21a. Annotations whose anchored text is removed by an edit are automatically deleted.
35. **Annotations Are Edge Links, Scoped to Corpus:** Document annotations attach a specific edge (concept-in-context) to a text selection. Annotations are scoped to the corpus, not the document globally — the same document in different corpuses has entirely separate annotations. This creates a bidirectional link: the annotation is clickable into the graph, and the document (within its corpus) appears in the edge's External Links page.
36. **No Algorithmic Change Logs:** The Phase 9 change log feature was dropped. Instead, users explore documents and graphs using color sets and annotation color set votes to understand how concepts are used in specific communities. Corpus subscriptions (Phase 7c) provide the structural basis for community exploration. The allowed-user annotation removal changelog (Phase 7g) provides accountability for curation within private layers.
37. **All Documents Are Publicly Visible:** Every document in Orca is viewable by any user. The public/private distinction applies only to the annotation layer — who can add and vote on annotations — not to the document content itself.
38. **Combined Public/Editorial Model (Corpus-Level):** Every corpus has both a public layer (any logged-in user can annotate/vote) and an editorial layer (only allowed users can annotate/vote, but visible to all). The corpus owner invites allowed users via invite link. Allowed users can filter to see only editorial-layer content. Allowed users can remove annotations with a changelog for accountability. This replaces the original binary public/private toggle. Renamed from "private" to "editorial" in Phase 10a.
39. **Usernames Visible to Corpus Members (Updated Phase 28e):** Within a corpus, all corpus members (owner and allowed users) can see each other's usernames in the members panel. Non-members see only a member count. Usernames also appear on annotations (as creator attribution) and are visible to all users. Votes on concepts (saves, swaps, links) remain anonymous — no usernames are shown on graph-level voting actions. The backend returns `isOwner` and `isMember` flags so the frontend can show invite links and remove buttons only for owners, while showing the member list to all members.
40. **Hiding Does Not Apply to Annotations:** Problematic concepts are hidden at the graph level, which prevents them from being used as annotations. No separate annotation-level hiding mechanism is needed.
41. **Color Set Voting Per Annotation:** When annotating a document (within a corpus), users specify a preferred color set for the annotated concept's children. Other users can vote for alternative color sets. Votes are per-annotation (per edge), consistent with all other voting. The annotator's choice is the default if no one else votes.
42. **Duplicate Detection on Upload:** Before committing a document upload, Orca checks for existing documents with high text similarity and shows matches to the user. This encourages finding an existing corpus rather than creating duplicates.
43. **Corpus Subscription = Persistent Tab:** Subscribing to a corpus creates a persistent tab in the main tab bar (for document browsing) and a corresponding tab on the Saved Page (for viewing saves associated with that corpus's annotations). Unsubscribing removes the main tab bar tab; saves remain on the Saved Page in an "Unsubscribed" tab until removed by the user. No explicit saved tab association is needed — save organization on the Saved Page is determined automatically by corpus annotation membership.
44. **Corpuses Are the Organizational Unit for Documents:** Documents always live inside corpuses. A document can be in multiple corpuses. Annotations, permissions, and subscriptions all operate at the corpus level, not the document level. Document lifecycle is governed by corpus membership — a document is deleted only when it's in zero corpuses. Corpus owners can add/remove documents (even ones they didn't upload) and delete the entire corpus.
45. **Decontextualized Document View — ❌ REMOVED (Phase 28, post-28f):** The standalone decontextualized document view (showing all annotations from all corpuses in a read-only view) was removed entirely. `DecontextualizedDocView.jsx` and `DocumentPage.jsx` were deleted. The `/documents/:id` route was removed from App.jsx. Guest annotation clicks now open the login modal (Phase 28f) instead of the decontextualized view. Cross-corpus annotation exploration is handled by the ConceptAnnotationPanel (Phase 27). The `getAllDocumentAnnotations` backend endpoint remains in place but is no longer called from the frontend.
46. **Document Favoriting Is Per-Corpus:** Users can favorite documents within a specific corpus to float them to the top of that corpus's document list. Favoriting in one corpus does not affect the document's position in other corpuses.

## Completed Phase Narratives (Phases 31–36)

### Phase 31: Annotation Messaging (31a–d COMPLETE)

Private messaging system anchored to annotations. Every thread is a group chat between a document's **author group** (uploader + coauthors) and one **external user**. Two initiation modes, one unified thread model.

#### Design Spec

**Core concept:**
Messaging is always about a specific annotation on a specific document. There are two ways to start a thread:

1. **"Message author(s)"** — any user (who is not the sole author of the document) clicks this on an annotation to start a conversation with the document's author group. Coauthors can also use this on their own documents, creating an author group chat about an annotation.
2. **"Message annotator"** — any document author clicks this on an annotation to reach out to the annotation's creator. The thread includes the full author group + the annotator. Only visible when the annotation creator is NOT already a coauthor (because if they are, the participant group would be identical to "Message author(s)").

**Thread identity:**
A thread is uniquely identified by `(annotation_id, external_user_id, thread_type)`. The `external_user_id` is the one participant who isn't in the author group — either the person who messaged the authors, or the annotator being contacted. Thread types: `to_authors` and `to_annotator`.

**Participant rules:**
- Participants = author group (derived at query time from `documents.uploaded_by` + `document_authors` via root document lookup) + `external_user_id`
- No explicit participants table — participants computed at query time, consistent with how coauthor identity works elsewhere
- New coauthors automatically gain access to all existing threads on that document (query-time computation). The UI should warn when adding a coauthor that they will see all existing message threads.
- Any participant can send messages in a thread they belong to

**Button visibility rules per annotation:**
- **Already a participant in any thread for this annotation** → Show **"View threads"** button that deep-links to the Messages page filtered to that annotation. No initiation buttons shown.
- **Not a participant + not the sole author viewing their own doc** → Show **"Message author(s)"** button
- **Not a participant + is a document author + annotation creator is NOT a coauthor** → Also show **"Message annotator"** button
- **Sole author viewing their own document** → No "Message author(s)" button (no point messaging yourself). Only "Message annotator" for annotations by non-authors.

**Messages page (sidebar navigation):**
Accessed from the sidebar alongside Browse, Graph Votes, and Saved. Page-by-page drill-down with three levels:

1. **Documents level (top):** Two collapsible sections — "My Documents" and "Others' Documents" — both expanded by default. Documents listed inline within each section with unread count badges. Users can click a document directly without an extra navigation step.
2. **Annotations level:** Within a document, list of annotations that have threads. Each shows concept breadcrumb path (parent path with bold concept name), quote text, and comment, plus unread count.
3. **Threads level:** Within an annotation, individual threads with specific users. Click into one to open the chat view.

The "View threads" button on annotation cards deep-links directly to the annotation's threads level in the Messages page.

**Unread tracking:**
- Total unread count displayed on the Messages sidebar button
- Subtotals bubble up at each drill-down level: per-document, per-annotation, per-thread
- Tracked via `last_read_at` timestamp per user per thread — messages with `created_at > last_read_at` are unread
- Reading a thread updates `last_read_at` to current time

#### Database Tables (Phase 31)

**`message_threads`** — Links an annotation to a conversation thread.

```sql
CREATE TABLE message_threads (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  annotation_id INTEGER REFERENCES document_annotations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  external_user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  thread_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (thread_type IN ('to_authors', 'to_annotator')),
  created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(annotation_id, external_user_id, thread_type)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_message_threads_annotation ON message_threads(annotation_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_message_threads_external_user ON message_threads(external_user_id);
```

Key points:
- `annotation_id` scopes the thread to a specific annotation (which itself is scoped to a corpus + document)
- `external_user_id` is the one participant outside the author group — either the person who clicked "Message author(s)" or the annotator being contacted via "Message annotator"
- `thread_type` distinguishes the two initiation modes: `'to_authors'` (outsider → author group) or `'to_annotator'` (author group → annotator)
- `UNIQUE(annotation_id, external_user_id, thread_type)` prevents duplicate threads
- `created_by` tracks who initiated the thread (may differ from `external_user_id` for `to_annotator` threads, where an author initiates but the annotator is the external user)
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from `document_annotations` — if an annotation is somehow removed (currently annotations are permanent, but future-proofing), threads go with it
- Participants are NOT stored explicitly — derived at query time: author group (root doc's `uploaded_by` + `document_authors`) UNION `external_user_id`

**`messages`** — Individual messages within a thread.

```sql
CREATE TABLE messages (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  thread_id INTEGER REFERENCES message_threads(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  sender_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_messages_thread ON messages(thread_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_thread_created ON messages(thread_id, created_at);
```

Key points:
- `body` is the message text content (plain text, no markdown)
- `sender_id` must be a valid participant (author group member or external user) — enforced at application level
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from `message_threads` ensures cleanup
- Compound index on `(thread_id, created_at)` for efficient chronological message loading
- Messages are append-only — no editing or deletion (consistent with Orca's append-only philosophy)

**`message_read_status`** — Tracks read state per user per thread.

```sql
CREATE TABLE message_read_status (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  thread_id INTEGER REFERENCES message_threads(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  last_read_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(thread_id, user_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_message_read_status_user ON message_read_status(user_id);
```

Key points:
- `last_read_at` timestamp — any message in the thread with `created_at > last_read_at` is unread for this user
- Row is upserted when a user opens a thread (set `last_read_at = NOW()`)
- If no row exists for a user+thread, all messages in that thread are unread for them
- Unread counts at each hierarchy level computed by aggregating across threads the user participates in
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from both `message_threads` and `users` ensures cleanup

#### API Endpoints (Phase 31)

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/messages/threads/create` | Required | Create a new thread — params: `annotation_id`, `thread_type`, `body` (first message). Backend derives `external_user_id` from context. Returns thread with first message. |
| GET | `/api/messages/threads` | Required | Get all threads for the current user, grouped by document → annotation. Returns unread counts at each level. Accepts `?section=my_docs|others_docs` filter. |
| GET | `/api/messages/threads/:threadId` | Required | Get a single thread with all messages (chronological). Automatically updates `last_read_at`. |
| POST | `/api/messages/threads/:threadId/reply` | Required | Send a message in an existing thread — params: `body`. Returns the new message. |
| GET | `/api/messages/threads/:threadId/messages` | Required | Get messages for a thread with pagination — `?before=timestamp&limit=50`. For loading older messages. |
| GET | `/api/messages/unread-count` | Required | Get total unread message count for the current user (for sidebar badge). |
| GET | `/api/messages/annotations/:annotationId/status` | Required | Check if the current user is a participant in any thread for this annotation — returns thread IDs or empty (for button display logic). |

Authorization middleware: every endpoint validates that the requesting user is a participant in the thread (author group member or external user). Thread creation validates initiation permissions (not sole author for `to_authors`; must be author for `to_annotator`).

#### Implementation Plan

**Phase 31a — Database & Backend API (COMPLETE):**
- Migration for `message_threads`, `messages`, `message_read_status` tables
- `messagesController.js` with all 7 endpoints: create thread, get threads (hierarchical grouped by document → annotation with unread counts, `?section` filter), get single thread (auto-marks read), reply, paginated messages (`?before&limit`), unread count, annotation participation status
- Authorization on every endpoint validates participant status (query-time from author group + external_user_id via root document CTE)
- Root document lookup reuses existing `getRootDocumentId` / `isDocumentAuthor` from `utils/documentLineage.js`
- Route definitions in `routes/messages.js`, registered in `server.js`
- Frontend `messagesAPI` methods added to `api.js` for all 7 endpoints

**Phase 31b — Messages Page UI (COMPLETE):**
- `MessagesPage.jsx` with three-level drill-down: documents (with collapsible sections) → annotations → threads
- Top level shows two collapsible sections ("My Documents" / "Others' Documents"), both expanded by default, with documents listed inline for direct access
- Annotations level shows concept breadcrumb path (parent path with bold concept name), quote text, and comment
- Unread count badges at every drill-down level (section, document, annotation, thread)
- "Messages" sidebar button in `AppShell.jsx` with total unread badge (polled every 60s)
- Back navigation at each level, proper overlay toggling with all other sidebar items
- Zen aesthetic: EB Garamond throughout, neutral dark unread badges, no colored buttons/emoji/italics

**Phase 31c — Thread View & Annotation Buttons (COMPLETE):**
- `MessageThread.jsx` — chat-style UI with chronological messages, sender usernames, timestamps, reply bar with Enter-to-send (Shift+Enter for newlines), auto-scroll to bottom
- Auto-mark-as-read when opening a thread (backend upserts `last_read_at` on GET `/threads/:threadId`)
- Annotation messaging buttons in `CorpusTabContent.jsx` with four visibility conditions: already-participant shows "View threads" (deep-links to annotation's threads level in Messages page); non-sole-author shows "Message author(s)"; document author seeing non-coauthor annotation shows "Message annotator"; sole author sees neither initiation button
- Inline compose box with textarea, Send/Cancel buttons for thread creation
- `getThreads` backend query enhanced to join `edges`/`concepts` tables for annotation concept name and graph_path, with batch resolution of path IDs to concept names
- Deep-link navigation: "View threads" button passes `initialAnnotationId` through AppShell → MessagesPage, which auto-navigates to the matching annotation's threads level

**Phase 31d — Polish, Version-Aware Threads & Annotation Copy (COMPLETE):**
- Version-aware thread display: `getThreads` and `getAnnotationStatus` use lineage CTEs to group threads across document versions by annotation equivalence (same `edge_id` + same `quote_text`)
- **Annotation copy on version creation (gap fix):** `createVersion` now copies all `document_annotations` rows and their `annotation_votes` from source to new version via INSERT...SELECT within the existing transaction. Does NOT copy `message_threads` (threads remain anchored to original annotations). Without this, version-aware thread display and annotation navigation had nothing to match against on new versions.
- **Cross-version annotation deduplication:** `getAnnotationsForEdge` and `getAnnotationsForConcept` now deduplicate across version chains using `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY root_document_id, corpus_id, created_by, quote_text ORDER BY version_number DESC)` — only the most recent version's annotation is returned. Per-document view (`CorpusTabContent`) is NOT deduplicated (shows all annotations for the specific version).
- **Version navigation buttons on annotation cards:** When viewing a document with multiple versions, annotation cards show "← v1" / "v3 →" buttons if equivalent annotations exist on adjacent versions. Clicking navigates to that version and scrolls to the quote. Powered by new `GET /api/documents/:id/version-annotation-map` endpoint.
- New endpoint: `GET /api/documents/:id/version-annotation-map` — returns lightweight annotation fingerprints `{document_id, version_number, edge_id, quote_text}` across all versions in a document's lineage via bidirectional recursive CTE
- Coauthor change warning ("New coauthors will see all existing message threads on this document")
- Empty states for Messages page ("No message threads yet") and thread view ("No messages yet")
- Relative timestamp formatting ("2m ago", "3h ago", "Yesterday", "Mar 15") with date separators in thread view
- Sidebar unread badge immediate refresh on thread back-navigation (no wait for 60s poll)
- End-to-end testing: 22/22 tests passed for 31d features

#### Architecture Decisions (Phase 31)

- **No explicit participants table:** Thread participants are derived at query time from the document's author group (`documents.uploaded_by` + `document_authors` via root document CTE) plus `message_threads.external_user_id`. This is consistent with how coauthor identity works for annotation filtering (Phase 26d) and ensures new coauthors automatically gain access to existing threads.
- **Append-only messages:** Messages cannot be edited or deleted, consistent with Orca's append-only philosophy. Quality control is social, not mechanical.
- **Thread scoping via annotations:** Threads are scoped to annotations (not documents directly). Since annotations are themselves scoped to corpus + document, this provides full context without redundant foreign keys on the thread table.
- **`external_user_id` unification:** Both thread types use the same field to identify the non-author participant. For `to_authors` threads, this is the person who reached out. For `to_annotator` threads, this is the annotator. The author group is always on the other side. This simplifies queries significantly.
- **Button state derived from participation:** Rather than complex conditional logic about thread types and roles, the UI simply checks "am I in any thread for this annotation?" — if yes, show "View threads"; if no, show the appropriate initiation button(s). This prevents duplicate-group threads naturally.
- **Annotation copy on version creation (Phase 31d):** `createVersion` copies all `document_annotations` and `annotation_votes` from source to new version. This was a critical gap — without copied annotations, version-aware thread grouping and version navigation buttons had no equivalent annotations to match against on new versions. Threads are NOT copied (they stay anchored to the original annotation, and the version-aware queries find them via lineage + equivalence). Vote copying maps old→new annotation IDs via ordered queries within the same transaction.
- **Aggregating-view deduplication (Phase 31d):** `getAnnotationsForEdge` and `getAnnotationsForConcept` deduplicate annotations that exist across multiple versions of the same document (a consequence of annotation copying). Uses SQL window function `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY root_document_id, corpus_id, created_by, COALESCE(quote_text, '') ORDER BY version_number DESC)` to keep only the most recent version's annotation. Per-document view is intentionally NOT deduplicated — users viewing a specific version should see all annotations on that version.
- **Annotation equivalence:** Two annotations are considered "equivalent" across versions when they share the same `edge_id` and `quote_text` (or both NULL). This is the matching key used for version-aware thread grouping, cross-version deduplication, and version navigation buttons.

### Phase 32: Phone OTP Authentication (32a–e COMPLETE)

**Goal:** Replace email + password authentication with phone number + one-time-password (SMS code) authentication. Achieves two goals: (1) one human = one account (phone numbers are much harder to multiply than email addresses), and (2) less sensitive data stored (eliminates password hashes and email addresses; stores only bcrypt-hashed phone numbers, unrecoverable even in a full database breach).

**External dependency:** Twilio Verify API (handles sending and validating SMS codes)
**Cost:** ~$0.05 per verification (Twilio Verify pricing, includes SMS delivery)
**New npm packages:** `twilio`, `express-rate-limit`

**Auth flow:** phone number → SMS code → JWT (no passwords anywhere). Old username/email/password flow removed in Phase 32d.

#### Phase 32a: Twilio Setup + Database Migration (COMPLETE)

- Installed `twilio` and `express-rate-limit` npm packages on backend
- Database migration: `ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS phone_hash VARCHAR(255);` (nullable — existing test users don't have phone numbers yet)
- New utility: `backend/src/utils/phoneAuth.js` — exports `normalizePhone` (E.164 normalization with US +1 default), `sendVerificationCode`, `checkVerificationCode` (Twilio Verify API wrappers)
- Updated `.env.example` with `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID` placeholders
- **Remaining for later sub-phases:** Twilio account/Verify Service creation

#### Phase 32b: New Auth Endpoints (Backend) (COMPLETE)

- Database migration: `email` and `password_hash` made nullable (phone-based registrations don't provide these), added `token_issued_after TIMESTAMP` column
- Updated `.env.example`: `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` changed from `7d` to `90d`
- Auth middleware (`middleware/auth.js`): after JWT signature verification, queries `token_issued_after` from database and rejects tokens with `iat <= token_issued_after`. Applied to both `authenticateToken` (returns 401) and `optionalAuth` (clears `req.user`, treats as guest). Uses `<=` comparison to handle same-second edge case.
- Rate limiter: `express-rate-limit` on `/send-code` — 5 requests per IP per 15 minutes. Prevents SMS bombing. Defined in `routes/auth.js`.
- New controller functions in `authController.js`: `sendCode`, `verifyRegister`, `verifyLogin`, `logoutEverywhere`
- `verifyRegister` validates username format and uniqueness BEFORE calling Twilio (avoids burning OTP on invalid input)
- Phone uniqueness check: originally O(n) bcrypt scan (Phase 32b). Replaced in Phase 33e with O(1) HMAC lookup via `phone_lookup` column with UNIQUE constraint.
- New routes: `/send-code` (rate-limited), `/verify-register`, `/verify-login`, `/logout-everywhere` (auth required)
- Legacy `/register` and `/login` endpoints preserved (removed in Phase 32d, now complete)

**Files changed:**
- `backend/src/config/migrate.js` — Phase 32b migration block
- `backend/.env.example` — JWT_EXPIRES_IN 7d → 90d
- `backend/src/middleware/auth.js` — `checkTokenIssuedAfter` helper, async verify callbacks, DB pool import
- `backend/src/controllers/authController.js` — Four new controller functions, `phoneAuth` import
- `backend/src/routes/auth.js` — Four new routes, `express-rate-limit` import and limiter config

#### Phase 32c: Frontend — New Login/Register UI (COMPLETE)

Rewrote `LoginModal.jsx` with two-step phone-based OTP flow, replacing the old username/email/password forms:

**Sign Up:** (1) Username + phone number with +1 prefix + "Send Code" button → (2) 6-digit code input + "Verify & Create Account" button
**Log In:** (1) Phone number with +1 prefix + "Send Code" button → (2) 6-digit code input + "Verify & Log In" button

- US +1 country code shown as static prefix next to phone input; input accepts raw 10 digits only
- "Resend code" link appears after 30-second cooldown (countdown timer via `useEffect`/`setInterval`)
- "Back" link on Step 2 returns to Step 1, pre-fills previous entries
- Tab switching resets step to 1 and clears all form state
- `AuthContext.jsx` — added `sendCode`, `phoneRegister`, `phoneLogin`, `logoutEverywhere` functions (old `login`/`register` removed in Phase 32d)
- `api.js` — added `authAPI.sendCode()`, `authAPI.verifyRegister()`, `authAPI.verifyLogin()`, `authAPI.logoutEverywhere()` methods (old methods removed in Phase 32d)
- `AppShell.jsx` — added "Logout everywhere" button next to existing "Logout" button in header user section. Regular logout clears local token only; "Logout everywhere" calls `/auth/logout-everywhere` (invalidates all JWTs via `token_issued_after`), then clears local state. Even if the API call fails, local cleanup still runs.
- Design: EB Garamond on all elements, black-on-off-white Zen aesthetic, no colored buttons, no italics, no emoji. Error messages in dark red (#c00).

**Files changed:**
- `frontend/src/components/LoginModal.jsx` — Full rewrite: phone OTP two-step flow
- `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` — Four new functions: `sendCode`, `phoneRegister`, `phoneLogin`, `logoutEverywhere`
- `frontend/src/services/api.js` — Four new authAPI methods
- `frontend/src/components/AppShell.jsx` — "Logout everywhere" button in header

#### Phase 32d: Migration — Existing Users + Cleanup (COMPLETE)

- Migration script in `migrate.js` assigns bcrypt-hashed fake phone numbers (Twilio test range +15005550001–006) to test users alice–frank. Each user checked for `phone_hash IS NULL` before hashing; idempotent on re-run. Wrapped in try/catch per user so one failure doesn't block others.
- Removed old `/register` and `/login` endpoints from `authController.js` and `routes/auth.js`. These routes now return 404.
- Removed old `authAPI.login()` and `authAPI.register()` from `frontend/src/services/api.js`
- Removed old `login()` and `register()` functions from `AuthContext.jsx`. Provider value now exports only: `user`, `loading`, `error`, `logout`, `sendCode`, `phoneRegister`, `phoneLogin`, `logoutEverywhere`, `isAuthenticated`, `isGuest`
- `password_hash` and `email` columns retained (append-only philosophy) but functionally retired — no auth code reads or writes them
- `Login.jsx` and `Register.jsx` page files are already gone (not present in `frontend/src/pages/`)

**Files changed:**
- `backend/src/config/migrate.js` — Phase 32d migration block (test user phone hashes)
- `backend/src/controllers/authController.js` — Removed `register` and `login` functions
- `backend/src/routes/auth.js` — Removed `/register` and `/login` routes
- `frontend/src/services/api.js` — Removed `authAPI.login()` and `authAPI.register()`
- `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` — Removed old `login()` and `register()` functions

#### Phase 32e: Security Hardening + Documentation (COMPLETE)

Security verification: rate limiting (429 on 6th request), phone uniqueness (all test users have bcrypt hashes), token invalidation (401 on invalid/expired tokens), old endpoints removed (404), new endpoints respond correctly (400/401 as expected). Frontend builds with zero errors. No password or email references remain in active auth code paths.

Documentation: ORCA_STATUS.md updated with final Phase 32 state — users table schema, auth endpoints, architecture decisions, file structure, environment configuration.

**Risks:** Twilio outage blocks auth (low likelihood, 99.95% SLA); some users uncomfortable sharing phone number (mitigated by transparency about hashing; future phase could add Google OAuth as alternative); O(n) phone uniqueness check (optimization available if needed at scale).

### Phase 33: Plumbing Audit Remediation (33a–e)

**Goal:** Fix bugs, security holes, and infrastructure gaps identified by a comprehensive codebase audit. Organized by urgency — critical bugs first, then security hardening, then data integrity, then infrastructure polish, then scalability.

**Context:** Full audit performed March 2026 covering secrets, database management, error handling, auth/authorization, input validation, rate limiting, data integrity, file uploads, API patterns, startup/shutdown, logging, and dependencies. 23 findings total across all severity levels.

#### Phase 33a: Critical Bug Fixes — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Fix active bugs that affect normal use right now.

1. **Wrap Twilio calls in try/catch** — ✅ Done. All three Twilio call sites in authController.js (`sendCode`, `verifyRegister`, `verifyLogin`) now wrapped in try/catch returning 500 JSON error. Previously, if Twilio threw an exception the request would hang forever.

2. **Add permission check to `uploadDocument`** — ✅ Done. corpusController.js `uploadDocument` now checks that the requesting user is either the corpus owner (`corpuses.created_by`) or an allowed member (`corpus_allowed_users`) before processing the upload. Returns 403 if neither. Matches the pattern used by `addDocumentToCorpus`.

3. **Add `.catch()` fallbacks to all `Promise.all` members** — ✅ Done. Three locations fixed:
   - `AppShell.jsx` `loadAllTabs` — added `.catch()` to `getGraphTabs`, `getTabGroups`, `getMySubscriptions` (4th member `getSidebarItems` already had one)
   - `CorpusTabContent.jsx` `openDocument` — added `.catch()` to `getDocument` (returns null, with early-return guard) and `getVersionChain`
   - `OrphanRescueModal.jsx` `loadAvailableCorpuses` — added `.catch()` to `listMine` and `getMySubscriptions`

4. **Run `npm audit fix`** — ✅ Done. Backend: 2 packages updated, 0 vulnerabilities remaining. Frontend: 3 packages updated, 2 moderate vulnerabilities remaining (esbuild ≤0.24.2 / vite 0.11.0–6.1.6) — fix requires `--force` which would upgrade vite to v8 (breaking change), so deferred.

5. **EADDRINUSE auto-recovery** — ✅ Bonus fix. Added `server.on('error')` handler in server.js that detects `EADDRINUSE`, finds the stale process via `netstat`, kills it with `taskkill`, and retries the listen after 1 second. Previously the server would crash on restart if the port was still held by a zombie process.

#### Phase 33b: Security Hardening — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Close security gaps before real users are on the platform.

1. **Replace JWT secret** — ✅ Done. Replaced weak dictionary-word passphrase (`orcabeluganarwhal`) with a random 64-character hex string generated via `crypto.randomBytes(32)`. All existing JWTs invalidated (test users only). `.env.example` unchanged (keeps placeholder).

2. **Lock down CORS** — ✅ Done. Replaced `app.use(cors())` with origin-whitelist CORS in server.js. Allowed origins read from `CORS_ORIGINS` env var (comma-separated), falling back to `http://localhost:5173`. Requests from unlisted origins are rejected (no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header). `CORS_ORIGINS` added to both `.env` and `.env.example`.

3. **Add rate limiting to OTP verification endpoints** — ✅ Done. Added `verifyCodeLimiter` (10 attempts per IP per 15 minutes) to `POST /verify-login` and `POST /verify-register` in routes/auth.js. Existing `sendCodeLimiter` (5 per 15 min) on `/send-code` unchanged.

#### Phase 33c: Data Integrity — Transaction Wrapping — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Wrap multi-step database operations in transactions so partial failures don't leave data in broken states.

1. **Voting operations** — ✅ Done. `addVote` in votesController.js now wraps all write operations (delete replace_votes, insert votes loop, insert vote_tab_links loop) in a single `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` transaction. Read-only lookups (edge existence, path resolution) remain outside the transaction on the pool.

2. **Annotation creation** — ✅ Done. `createAnnotation` in corpusController.js now wraps the annotation INSERT and the auto-vote INSERT in a single transaction. If the auto-vote fails, the annotation is rolled back too — no more orphaned annotations with vote_count=0.

3. **User registration** — ✅ Done. `verifyRegister` in authController.js now wraps user INSERT and default "Saved" tab INSERT in a single transaction. Twilio verification and bcrypt operations remain outside the transaction (no network calls held open during the transaction). JWT signing also outside.

4. **Race condition in `createRootConcept`** — ✅ Done. Moved the duplicate name check (`SELECT ... WHERE LOWER(name) = LOWER($1)`) inside the transaction so it is serialized with the INSERT. No unique index exists on `concepts.name`, so `ON CONFLICT` was not usable — the in-transaction check prevents the race condition.

#### Phase 33d: Input Validation + Infrastructure Polish — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Add missing input validation and improve server infrastructure.

1. **Add max-length validation on unbounded text fields** — ✅ Done.
   - Message thread body: 10,000 char limit in `createThread` and `replyToThread` (messagesController.js)
   - Annotation `quote_text`: 2,000 char limit in `createAnnotation` (corpusController.js)
   - Annotation `comment`: 5,000 char limit in `createAnnotation` (corpusController.js)
   - All checks happen before any database work, return 400 with clear error messages.

2. **Configure explicit database pool limits** — ✅ Done. database.js now sets `max: 20`, `idleTimeoutMillis: 30000`, `connectionTimeoutMillis: 5000`.

3. **Close database pool on shutdown** — ✅ Done. Shutdown handler in server.js now calls `pool.end()` after `server.close()` completes, cleanly releasing all database connections.

4. **Add database health check at startup** — ✅ Done. server.js runs `SELECT 1` before `app.listen()`. If PostgreSQL is unreachable, logs "ERROR: Cannot connect to PostgreSQL. Is the database running?" and exits with code 1. Server never starts if the database is down.

5. **Add missing FK constraint** — ✅ Done. Added idempotent migration in migrate.js: `ALTER TABLE document_concept_links_cache ADD CONSTRAINT fk_doc_concept_links_cache_concept FOREIGN KEY (concept_id) REFERENCES concepts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` (guarded by `IF NOT EXISTS` check).

6. **Tighten error message forwarding** — ✅ Done. Replaced four `error.message` forwards in corpusController.js with explicit hardcoded strings: "Document not found or has no version history" (invite token), "Document not found" (get authors), "Document not found for co-author removal" (remove author), "Document not found for leaving authorship" (leave authorship).

#### Phase 33e: O(n) Login Redesign — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Fix the most significant scalability risk in the codebase. Login and registration previously fetched ALL user phone hashes and ran `bcrypt.compare()` against each one sequentially — O(n) that would time out at ~10,000 users.

**Solution:** Added a deterministic `phone_lookup` column (HMAC-SHA256 of the normalized phone number, keyed by `PHONE_LOOKUP_KEY` env var). HMAC is deterministic, so it can be indexed and queried in O(1) via a UNIQUE constraint.

1. **New env var `PHONE_LOOKUP_KEY`** — ✅ Done. Random 32-byte hex key added to `.env` and `.env.example`. Used by `computePhoneLookup()` in phoneAuth.js.

2. **New utility `computePhoneLookup()`** — ✅ Done. Added to `phoneAuth.js`: `crypto.createHmac('sha256', PHONE_LOOKUP_KEY).update(normalizedPhone).digest('hex')`. Returns a 64-character hex string.

3. **Database migration** — ✅ Done. Added `phone_lookup VARCHAR(64)` column with `UNIQUE` constraint (`users_phone_lookup_key`). Backfilled all 6 test users (alice–frank) using their known phone numbers (+15005550001 through +15005550006). Guarded by `IF NOT EXISTS` checks for idempotency.

4. **`verifyRegister` rewritten** — ✅ Done. Phone uniqueness check replaced: was `SELECT all phone_hashes → bcrypt.compare() loop`, now `SELECT id FROM users WHERE phone_lookup = $1`. INSERT now includes `phone_lookup` alongside `phone_hash`.

5. **`verifyLogin` rewritten** — ✅ Done. User lookup replaced: was `SELECT all phone_hashes → bcrypt.compare() loop`, now `SELECT id, username FROM users WHERE phone_lookup = $1`. Single-row result, no bcrypt needed.

6. **No remaining O(n) patterns** — ✅ Verified. Grep for `phone_hash IS NOT NULL` returns zero matches in the codebase.

**Files changed:**
- `backend/.env` — added `PHONE_LOOKUP_KEY`
- `backend/.env.example` — added `PHONE_LOOKUP_KEY` placeholder
- `backend/src/utils/phoneAuth.js` — added `crypto` import, `computePhoneLookup()` export
- `backend/src/controllers/authController.js` — imported `computePhoneLookup`, rewrote `verifyRegister` and `verifyLogin` to use O(1) HMAC lookup
- `backend/src/config/migrate.js` — Phase 33e migration block (column, constraint, test user backfill)

---

**Audit findings NOT included in Phase 33 (deferred):**
- Pagination on list endpoints — fine for small userbase, add when data grows
- Rate limiting on content creation endpoints — low abuse risk with small userbase
- Structured logging / request IDs — adequate for current scale
- Vite/esbuild dev-server vulnerabilities — dev-only, not a production risk

### Phase 34: Corpus & Document Search Fields — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Add client-side search/filter fields to the Browse Corpuses view and to corpus document lists, so users can quickly find corpuses and documents without scrolling. All filtering is client-side (data already loaded in state). No new backend endpoints needed.

#### Phase 34a: Corpus Search in CorpusListView — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Add two independent search fields to `CorpusListView.jsx` — one on the "My Corpuses" section and one on the "All Corpuses" section.

- Replaced toggle-based view (viewMode 'all'/'mine') with two always-visible sections: "My Corpuses" and "All Corpuses"
- Two new state variables: `myCorpusSearch`, `allCorpusSearch` — each filters its respective list by `corpus.name` (case-insensitive substring match)
- The two fields are completely independent — typing in one does NOT affect the other
- Guest handling: entire "My Corpuses" section (including search field) gated behind `!isGuest`; "All Corpuses" always renders
- Small inline search inputs on each section header line with ✕ clear button (appears when field has text)
- Styling: EB Garamond font, 1px solid #ccc border, off-white background (#faf9f6), 13px font size
- Files changed: `CorpusListView.jsx` only

#### Phase 34b: Document Search in CorpusDetailView — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Add "My Documents" and "All Documents" sections with independent search fields to `CorpusDetailView.jsx` (the Browse overlay corpus view).

- Existing "My Documents" / "All Documents" sections already present from Phase 21b — added search inputs to each section header
- Two new state variables: `myDocSearch`, `allDocSearch` — each filters its respective list by `doc.title` (case-insensitive substring match)
- My Documents: filters `groupDocsByLineage(documents)` by `_chainUploaders.has(currentUserId)`, then by search term
- My Documents section hidden entirely when user has no docs and no active search
- All Documents section always visible; shows all corpus documents with independent search
- Guest handling: entire My Documents section (including search) gated behind `!isGuest`
- No backend changes needed — `uploaded_by` already returned in `getCorpus` document query
- Search inputs placed inline on section headers with ✕ clear buttons, EB Garamond font, off-white background
- Files changed: `CorpusDetailView.jsx` only

#### Phase 34c: Document Search in CorpusTabContent — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Add the same "My Documents" / "All Documents" sections with search fields to `CorpusTabContent.jsx` (the sidebar tab corpus view).

- Two new state variables: `myDocSearch`, `allDocSearch` — each filters its respective list by `doc.title` (case-insensitive substring match)
- My Documents: filters `groupDocsByLineage(documents)` by `_chainUploaders.has(user?.id)`, then by search term; hidden when user has no docs and no active search
- Existing tag filter and favorite sorting preserved alongside new search filtering
- Search fields only visible on document list view — component early-returns document viewer when `subView !== 'list'`
- Both search states reset to '' in `handleBackToList` when returning from document view
- Guest handling: entire My Documents section (including search) gated behind `!isGuest`
- Search inputs inline on section headers with ✕ clear buttons, EB Garamond font, off-white background
- Behavior matches CorpusDetailView (Phase 34b) — same filtering logic, same user gating, same section structure
- Files changed: `CorpusTabContent.jsx` only

#### Phase 34 Verification Checklist
1. CorpusListView: "My Corpuses" and "All Corpuses" searches are independent
2. CorpusDetailView (Browse overlay): "My Documents" and "All Documents" searches are independent
3. CorpusTabContent (sidebar tab): "My Documents" and "All Documents" searches are independent
4. **Cross-check:** same corpus via Browse overlay vs sidebar tab — both have working document search
5. Guest mode: only "All" sections and search fields appear
6. Clean build: `cd frontend && npm run build` succeeds

### Phase 35: Document Deletion & Account Deletion — 🟡 IN PROGRESS

**Goal:** Allow users to delete documents they uploaded (removing from all corpuses and deleting all associated annotations, messages, and votes). Allow users to delete their account, with a guided flow for transferring corpus ownership and managing documents before deletion.

#### Phase 35a: Document Deletion + Shared Component Extraction — ✅ DONE

**Goal:** Users can permanently delete a specific document version they uploaded. Deletion removes that single version from all corpuses and destroys all associated annotations, messages, and votes on that version. Additionally, extract shared UI components from `CorpusTabContent.jsx` and `CorpusDetailView.jsx` to eliminate persistent feature divergence between the two corpus views.

**Behavior:**
- Only the original uploader (`documents.uploaded_by`) can delete a document version
- Deletion targets a single document row — the specific version identified by `:id` in the URL. Other versions in the chain (whether uploaded by the same user or by co-authors) are NOT affected.
- If the deleted version was referenced by another version's `source_document_id`, that FK becomes NULL automatically via the existing `ON DELETE SET NULL` constraint — the referencing version becomes a standalone document (or a new chain root).
- Co-author records (`document_authors`) referencing a deleted root document CASCADE away. Surviving versions that were downstream lose their co-author associations (accepted edge case for launch).

**Cascade chain for the deleted document:**
1. `document_annotations` CASCADE → `annotation_votes` CASCADE, `message_threads` CASCADE → `messages` CASCADE → `message_read_status` CASCADE
2. `corpus_documents` CASCADE (removed from all corpuses)
3. `document_concept_links_cache` CASCADE
4. `document_favorites` CASCADE
5. `document_authors` CASCADE (if this was the root doc)
6. `document_invite_tokens` CASCADE (if this was the root doc)
7. The `documents` row itself is deleted

**API endpoint:**
- `POST /api/documents/:id/delete` — Auth required, uploader only (`uploaded_by = req.user.userId`)
- Deletes the single document row in a transaction with `AND uploaded_by = $2` safety belt
- Returns `{ deletedDocumentId }`
- Returns 403 if requesting user is not the uploader of the specified document
- Returns 404 if document not found

**Frontend UI:**
- "Delete" button on document cards in the document list, visible only to the uploader of that version
- Confirmation modal warning that all annotations and messages on this version will be permanently lost
- If document is part of a version chain, modal shows a note: "Other versions of this document will not be affected."
- After deletion, corpus document list refreshes automatically
- Button styling: transparent background, dark text, neutral border (consistent with Orca's design language — no red/danger colors)

**Shared component extraction:**
Three areas of document/corpus UI code were duplicated between `CorpusTabContent.jsx` and `CorpusDetailView.jsx`, causing persistent feature divergence (every feature added to one view was missed in the other). Fix: extract three shared presentational components that receive data and callbacks via props. Both parent components render the shared components instead of maintaining separate copies.

1. **`CorpusDocumentList.jsx`** (802 lines) — My/All Documents sections with collapse toggle, search fields, tag filter bar, document cards (title, meta row, version badge, tag pills with remove, favorite star, tag assignment dropdown, delete button for uploaders, remove button for owners), delete confirmation modal. Internal state: search terms, tag filter, collapse, tag menu, delete modal. All API calls via callbacks from parent.

2. **`CorpusUploadForm.jsx`** (602 lines) — Upload toggle button, drag-and-drop zone, file picker, title input, tag picker (single-select with search suggestions), add-existing-document search/picker. Only renders for corpus owners or allowed members (`isOwner || isAllowedUser`). Internal state: form fields, upload progress, search results. API calls via callbacks.

3. **`CorpusMembersPanel.jsx`** (~420 lines) — Member list with remove button (owner only), invite link generation/copy/revoke, leave corpus button (non-owner members), member count for non-members. Inline transfer ownership UI for owners (select member, confirm, transfer — Phase 35b). Internal state: generating/copying/leaving/transfer loading states. API calls via callbacks.

**Parity gaps fixed by extraction:**
- Favorites (star toggle) — was missing from CorpusDetailView
- Tag assignment (add/change/remove tags on doc cards) — was missing from CorpusDetailView
- Tag filter bar (filter docs by tag) — was missing from CorpusDetailView
- Tag picker during upload — was missing from CorpusDetailView
- Upload visibility — restricted to corpus owners and allowed members (was previously visible to all logged-in users)

**Files changed:**
- `backend/src/controllers/corpusController.js` — new `deleteDocument` function (transaction-wrapped, single-row delete with `uploaded_by` safety belt)
- `backend/src/routes/documents.js` — new route `POST /:id/delete` with `authenticateToken`
- `frontend/src/services/api.js` — new `documentsAPI.deleteDocument(documentId)` method
- `frontend/src/components/CorpusTabContent.jsx` — refactored to use shared components (reduced from ~4950 to 3269 lines). Retains document viewer, annotations, messaging, version navigation, co-author management.
- `frontend/src/components/CorpusDetailView.jsx` — refactored to use shared components (reduced from ~1930 to 640 lines). Retains corpus header, edit/delete corpus, subscribe/unsubscribe.
- **NEW** `frontend/src/components/CorpusDocumentList.jsx` — shared document list component
- **NEW** `frontend/src/components/CorpusUploadForm.jsx` — shared upload form component
- **NEW** `frontend/src/components/CorpusMembersPanel.jsx` — shared members panel component

See Architecture Decision #211.

#### Phase 35b: Corpus Ownership Transfer — ✅ DONE

**Goal:** Allow a corpus owner to transfer ownership to an existing corpus member (allowed user). Required as a prerequisite for account deletion, but also useful as a standalone feature.

**API endpoint:**
- `POST /api/corpuses/:id/transfer-ownership` — Owner only
- Body: `{ newOwnerId }` — must be an existing allowed user of the corpus (`corpus_allowed_users`)
- Validates: corpus exists (404), requester is owner (403), newOwnerId is a number (400), not self-transfer (400), target is existing member (400)
- Transaction performs three atomic operations:
  1. Updates `corpuses.created_by` to the new owner
  2. Removes the new owner from `corpus_allowed_users` (now implicitly a member as owner)
  3. Adds the old owner to `corpus_allowed_users` with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` (becomes a regular member)
- Returns `{ message, newOwnerId, corpusId }`

**Frontend UI:**
- Inline transfer flow in `CorpusMembersPanel.jsx`, visible only to owners when there are non-owner members
- Small "Transfer ownership" text button below member list (not prominent — rarely used)
- Clicking shows member pick list with "Transfer to [username]" buttons
- Confirmation step: "Transfer ownership of this corpus to [username]? You will become a regular member." with Confirm/Cancel
- Both `CorpusTabContent.jsx` and `CorpusDetailView.jsx` wire the callback, refreshing corpus data + member list after successful transfer

**Files changed:**
- `backend/src/controllers/corpusController.js` — new `transferOwnership` function with transaction
- `backend/src/routes/corpuses.js` — new route `/:id/transfer-ownership`
- `frontend/src/services/api.js` — new `corpusAPI.transferOwnership(corpusId, newOwnerId)` method
- `frontend/src/components/CorpusMembersPanel.jsx` — inline transfer UI with 4 state variables (showTransferUI, selectedTransferTarget, confirmingTransfer, transferring)
- `frontend/src/components/CorpusTabContent.jsx` — `handleTransferOwnership` callback wired to panel
- `frontend/src/components/CorpusDetailView.jsx` — `handleTransferOwnership` callback wired to panel

#### Phase 35c: Account Deletion Backend — ✅ DONE

**Goal:** Backend infrastructure for account deletion. Migration to fix foreign key constraints that block user deletion, plus the delete-account endpoint.

**Migration — Changed 12 provenance FKs to `ON DELETE SET NULL`:**
These foreign keys referenced `users(id)` with no `ON DELETE` clause (PostgreSQL defaults to `RESTRICT`, blocking deletion). Each was dropped and re-added with `ON DELETE SET NULL` using idempotent `DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS` + `ADD CONSTRAINT` pattern, wrapped in try/catch:
- `concepts.created_by` (`concepts_created_by_fkey`)
- `attributes.created_by` (`attributes_created_by_fkey`)
- `edges.created_by` (`edges_created_by_fkey`)
- `concept_links.added_by` (`concept_links_added_by_fkey`)
- `corpuses.created_by` (`corpuses_created_by_fkey`)
- `documents.uploaded_by` (`documents_uploaded_by_fkey`)
- `corpus_documents.added_by` (`corpus_documents_added_by_fkey`)
- `document_annotations.created_by` (`document_annotations_created_by_fkey`)
- `corpus_invite_tokens.created_by` (`corpus_invite_tokens_created_by_fkey`)
- `document_invite_tokens.created_by` (`document_invite_tokens_created_by_fkey`)
- `document_tags.created_by` (`document_tags_created_by_fkey`)
- `message_threads.created_by` (`message_threads_created_by_fkey`)

**Note:** 26+ other FKs already had `ON DELETE CASCADE` (votes, subscriptions, tabs, messages, flags, etc.). 2 FKs in `annotation_removal_log` already had `ON DELETE SET NULL`. After this migration, zero `RESTRICT` FKs remain on `users(id)`.

**New API endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/delete-account` (auth required)
- Pre-check: queries `corpuses WHERE created_by = $1`. Returns 400 with `{ error, corpuses: [{id, name}] }` if any exist.
- Wrapped in a transaction (pre-check + delete are atomic to prevent race conditions).
- Single `DELETE FROM users WHERE id = $1` — CASCADE and SET NULL handle all child tables automatically. No manual child table deletes.
- Returns `{ message: 'Account deleted successfully' }`.

**Files changed:**
- `backend/src/config/migrate.js` — Phase 35c migration block (12 FK alterations via loop)
- `backend/src/controllers/authController.js` — new `deleteAccount` function with transaction
- `backend/src/routes/auth.js` — `router.post('/delete-account', authenticateToken, authController.deleteAccount)`

#### Phase 35d: Account Deletion Frontend + Header Account Menu — ✅ DONE

**Goal:** Frontend deletion flow with guided corpus transfer/deletion, and header consolidation of logout actions into a dropdown menu.

**Part 1 — Header account menu consolidation:**
Replaced the separate "Logout" and "Logout everywhere" buttons with a single "Log out ▾" dropdown button. Dropdown has three options:
1. "Log out" — current session logout
2. "Log out everywhere" — invalidate all sessions
3. "Delete account" — opens the deletion flow

Dropdown uses `useRef` + `mousedown` listener for click-outside-to-close. Styled with off-white background (#faf9f6), 1px solid #ccc border, EB Garamond font, subtle hover effect. Only shown for authenticated users (not guests).

**Part 2 — `DeleteAccountFlow.jsx` (modal overlay):**
Three-step flow rendered as a fixed-position overlay (z-index 10000, semi-transparent backdrop):

1. **Step 1 — Corpus ownership:** Fetches `corpusAPI.listMine()` on mount. For each corpus, fetches members via `corpusAPI.listAllowedUsers()`. Corpuses with members show a transfer dropdown + "Transfer" button (calls `corpusAPI.transferOwnership`). Corpuses without members show "Delete Corpus" button (calls `corpusAPI.deleteCorpus`). "Continue" disabled until all resolved. Skipped entirely if user owns zero corpuses.
2. **Step 2 — Document notice:** Informational text about documents remaining anonymously. No blocking action.
3. **Step 3 — Final confirmation:** Text input requiring exact case-sensitive username match. "Permanently Delete My Account" button disabled until match. On success: closes modal, defers `logout()` via `setTimeout` to avoid unmount-during-render. On 400 error (still owns corpuses): returns to Step 1 with refreshed corpus list.

**Bug fix (document search):** `CorpusUploadForm.jsx` "Add existing document" search was broken — `res.data || []` should have been `res.data?.documents || []` since the API returns `{ documents: [...] }`. Search results never rendered because the object was truthy but had no `.length`.

**Bug fix (document search with deleted users):** `corpusController.js` `searchDocuments` used `JOIN users` (inner join), which excluded documents where `uploaded_by IS NULL` (from deleted users). Changed to `LEFT JOIN`.

**New API method:** `authAPI.deleteAccount()` — `POST /api/auth/delete-account`

**Files changed:**
- `frontend/src/components/DeleteAccountFlow.jsx` — new component (3-step deletion flow)
- `frontend/src/components/AppShell.jsx` — header dropdown menu, DeleteAccountFlow rendering, account menu state + click-outside handler, dropdown styles
- `frontend/src/services/api.js` — `authAPI.deleteAccount()` method
- `frontend/src/components/CorpusUploadForm.jsx` — bug fix: `res.data?.documents` for search results
- `backend/src/controllers/corpusController.js` — bug fix: `LEFT JOIN` in document search query

#### Phase 35 Architecture Decisions

- **Architecture Decision #208 — Document Deletion Is Version-Specific:** When a user deletes a document, only the single specified version is deleted — not the entire version chain. Other versions (whether uploaded by the same user or co-authors) are unaffected. If a downstream version referenced the deleted one via `source_document_id`, that FK becomes NULL via the existing `ON DELETE SET NULL` constraint, making the downstream version a standalone document. This gives users granular control — they can delete a flawed V1 while keeping a corrected V3 they also uploaded. Co-author records (`document_authors`) on deleted root documents are lost via CASCADE — surviving downstream versions lose co-author associations. Accepted tradeoff: co-authorship loss is an edge case unlikely at launch scale.

- **Architecture Decision #209 — Account Deletion Requires Pre-Transfer of Corpus Ownership:** Users cannot delete their account while they still own corpuses. The deletion flow guides them through transferring each corpus to an existing member. If a corpus has no members, the user must delete it or recruit a member first. This ensures no corpus is left ownerless and preserves community data. The transfer endpoint (`POST /corpuses/:id/transfer-ownership`) is also useful as a standalone feature independent of account deletion.

- **Architecture Decision #210 — Provenance FKs Changed to ON DELETE SET NULL:** Foreign keys for `created_by`, `added_by`, and `uploaded_by` columns that reference `users(id)` are changed from the default `RESTRICT` to `ON DELETE SET NULL`. This allows user deletion while preserving community contributions (concepts, edges, annotations, web links, documents) with NULL attribution. This is consistent with Orca's append-only philosophy — content is never deleted, only its authorship becomes anonymous.

- **Architecture Decision #211 — Corpus View Shared Components Extracted:** Three areas of UI code were duplicated between `CorpusTabContent.jsx` (persistent sidebar tab) and `CorpusDetailView.jsx` (Browse overlay), causing persistent feature divergence. Extracted into three shared presentational components: (1) `CorpusDocumentList.jsx` — document cards, My/All sections, search, tags, favorites, remove/delete; (2) `CorpusUploadForm.jsx` — drag-and-drop upload, file picker, add-existing-document; (3) `CorpusMembersPanel.jsx` — member list, invite links, leave/remove. All three receive data and callbacks via props (no direct API calls). Search and modal state is internal. The parent components retain their distinct responsibilities: `CorpusTabContent` handles the persistent tab with document viewer/annotations/messaging, `CorpusDetailView` handles the Browse overlay with corpus management and subscribe flow.

#### Phase 35 Verification Checklist
1. Document deletion: uploader can delete their own version, non-uploaders cannot (403)
2. Document deletion: only the specified version is deleted; other versions in the chain survive
3. Document deletion: annotations, messages, favorites, cache all cleaned up for the deleted version
4. Document deletion: downstream versions referencing the deleted one get `source_document_id = NULL`
5. Corpus transfer: owner can transfer to an allowed user; new owner becomes owner, old owner becomes member
6. Corpus transfer: non-owners get 403; non-members as target get 400
7. Account deletion: blocked if user still owns corpuses (400 with list)
8. Account deletion: after transferring all corpuses, deletion succeeds
9. Account deletion: concepts/edges/annotations persist with `created_by = NULL`
10. Account deletion: votes, subscriptions, tabs, messages all CASCADE deleted
11. Account deletion: JWT cleared client-side, user redirected to root
12. Account deletion: header dropdown consolidates Log out, Log out everywhere, Delete account
13. Account deletion: dropdown closes on click outside
14. Account deletion: deletion modal closes cleanly before logout (no stuck modal)
15. Document search: "Add existing document" returns results (res.data.documents fix)
16. Document search: documents from deleted users (uploaded_by NULL) still appear (LEFT JOIN fix)
17. Clean build: `cd frontend && npm run build` succeeds

### Phase 36: Legal Compliance — Age Verification, Email Collection, Copyright Confirmation — ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Goal:** Add three legal compliance features required before public launch: (1) age verification at sign-up (18+ checkbox with stored consent timestamp), (2) email collection at sign-up (required, for copyright violation notices and ToS/privacy updates), (3) copyright confirmation at document upload (checkbox with stored consent timestamp, applies to both original uploads and version uploads).

#### Phase 36a: Database Migration

**Users table — new column:**
- `age_verified_at TIMESTAMP` — nullable, set to `NOW()` when user checks the age verification checkbox during registration

**Documents table — new column:**
- `copyright_confirmed_at TIMESTAMP` — nullable, set to `NOW()` when uploader checks the copyright confirmation checkbox during upload

**Test user backfill:**
- Update alice–frank with fake emails: `alice@test.com`, `bob@test.com`, `carol@test.com`, `dave@test.com`, `eve@test.com`, `frank@test.com`
- Set `age_verified_at = NOW()` for all six test users (grandfathered)

#### Phase 36b: Backend Changes

**`verifyRegister` in `authController.js`:**
- Now accepts `{ phoneNumber, code, username, email, ageVerified }`
- Validates `email` is present and has valid format (basic regex: contains `@` and `.`)
- Validates `ageVerified === true` — returns 400 if false/missing
- Stores `email` in the `email` column (reactivated from Phase 32d retirement)
- Sets `age_verified_at = NOW()` in the INSERT statement
- Email uniqueness is NOT enforced — multiple accounts can share an email (one phone per account is the identity constraint)

**Document upload endpoint (`/:id/documents/upload` in `corpusController.js`):**
- Requires `copyrightConfirmed: true` in the request body (multipart form field or JSON field)
- Returns 400 if `copyrightConfirmed` is missing or not `true`
- Sets `copyright_confirmed_at = NOW()` in the document INSERT

**Version create endpoint (`/versions/create` in `corpusController.js`):**
- Same copyright confirmation requirement as upload
- Requires `copyrightConfirmed: true`, returns 400 if missing
- Sets `copyright_confirmed_at = NOW()` on the new version row

#### Phase 36c: Frontend Changes

**`LoginModal.jsx` — Sign Up tab, Step 2 (after OTP verification step):**
- New email input field (required, type="email", validated for format before submit)
- New checkbox: "I confirm I am at least 18 years old" (must be checked to enable submit button)
- Submit button disabled until: username filled, email filled and valid, age checkbox checked
- Sends `email` and `ageVerified: true` to `verifyRegister` endpoint

**`CorpusUploadForm.jsx` — upload form:**
- New checkbox: "I confirm I have the right to upload this content (I own it or it is in the public domain)" (must be checked to enable Upload button)
- Sends `copyrightConfirmed: true` with the upload request
- Checkbox resets when upload completes (ready for next upload)

**Version upload (wherever the "Create New Version" flow lives):**
- Same copyright confirmation checkbox as original upload
- Sends `copyrightConfirmed: true` with the version create request

#### Phase 36 Architecture Decisions

- **Architecture Decision #212 — Email Reactivated for Legal Notifications (Phase 36):** The `email` column on the `users` table, retired in Phase 32d when phone OTP replaced email+password auth, is reactivated for a new purpose: legal notifications (copyright violation notices, ToS/privacy policy updates). Email is required for new registrations (application-level enforcement) but the DB column remains nullable for backward compatibility. Email uniqueness is NOT enforced — multiple accounts may share an email, since phone number (one per account) remains the identity constraint. Email is NOT used for authentication.

- **Architecture Decision #213 — Consent Timestamps for Legal Defensibility (Phase 36):** Age verification and copyright confirmation are stored as timestamps (`age_verified_at` on `users`, `copyright_confirmed_at` on `documents`) rather than simple booleans. Timestamps provide a verifiable record of when consent was given, which is stronger evidence in dispute resolution. Age verification is per-user (set once at registration). Copyright confirmation is per-document (set at each upload, including version uploads), because each document upload is a separate legal assertion.

#### Phase 36 Bug Fix: LEFT JOIN on `uploaded_by` (prevents document disappearance after account deletion)

**Problem:** Five queries in `corpusController.js` used `JOIN users u ON u.id = d.uploaded_by` (inner join). When a user deletes their account, Phase 35c sets `documents.uploaded_by = NULL` (ON DELETE SET NULL). The inner JOIN then fails to match (NULL never equals anything), silently dropping the document from query results. Documents appeared to vanish from corpuses even though the rows still existed in the database.

**Affected queries (all changed to LEFT JOIN):**
1. `getCorpus` — corpus document list (line ~185) — documents by deleted users disappeared from corpus views
2. `checkDuplicates` — duplicate detection (line ~403) — could not detect duplicates of documents uploaded by deleted users
3. `getDocument` — single document fetch (line ~821) — returned 404 for documents whose uploader deleted their account
4. `getVersionHistory` — version history (line ~1071) — dropped versions uploaded by deleted users from the version chain display
5. `getDocumentAuthors` — author list (line ~2876) — omitted the original uploader if their account was deleted

**Not changed:** `getOrphanedDocuments` (line ~2449) — this query filters `WHERE d.uploaded_by = $1` for the current logged-in user, so `uploaded_by` is never NULL in that context. Inner JOIN is safe.

**Rule:** Any query that JOINs `users` via `documents.uploaded_by` (or any other SET NULL FK) **must** use `LEFT JOIN`, because the FK value becomes NULL when the referenced user is deleted. This applies to all provenance columns changed by Phase 35c (see the FK constraint list: `concepts.created_by`, `edges.created_by`, `corpuses.created_by`, `documents.uploaded_by`, `corpus_documents.added_by`, `document_annotations.created_by`, etc.). The frontend already handles NULL usernames gracefully (conditional rendering).

#### Phase 36 Verification Checklist
1. Sign Up: cannot complete registration without entering an email
2. Sign Up: cannot complete registration without checking age verification box
3. Sign Up: email stored in `users.email` column, `age_verified_at` set to a timestamp
4. Sign Up: invalid email format (no @, no .) rejected with error message
5. Document upload: cannot upload without checking copyright confirmation box
6. Document upload: `copyright_confirmed_at` set to a timestamp on the document row
7. Version upload: same copyright confirmation required, same timestamp stored
8. Test users: alice–frank have emails and `age_verified_at` after migration
9. Clean build: `cd frontend && npm run build` succeeds
10. Account deletion: documents uploaded by a now-deleted user still appear in corpus views (with null uploader username)

### Info Pages (Phase 30g + ongoing) — ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Goal:** Static informational pages with community comment sections. Three pages accessible via header navigation buttons: Using Orca (`/using-orca`), Constitution (`/constitution`), Donate (`/donate`).

**Component:** `InfoPage.jsx` — single component handles all three slugs. Detected via `INFO_SLUGS` array in `AppShell.jsx`.

**Layout:**
- Using Orca and Constitution use a **two-column layout**: left column = page content, right column = sticky comments section (heading: "Report Bugs / Request Enhancements" for Using Orca, "Community Comments" for others)
- Donate uses a single-column layout (placeholder content)
- `maxWidth: 1400px`, side padding `12px`, column gap `32px`

**Using Orca page content (`UsingOrcaContent` component):**
1. **Intro paragraph** — describes what Orca is (building shared value hierarchies, annotations, messaging)
2. **Three use case paragraphs** — Research, Product Development, Education. Each has a bold "Use Case: [Name]." label followed by description text
3. **Open source note** — "Orca is open source (link to github.com/orca-concepts/orca). Educators and organizations can run their own instance for a controlled environment."
4. **2×2 screenshot grid** — four cells arranged via CSS Grid (`gridTemplateColumns: '1fr 1fr'`), falls back to single-column stack on narrow screens (<768px via useState/useEffect resize listener):
   - **Value Hierarchy** — single screenshot (`step3.png`) with caption about Effect Size Reporting hierarchy
   - **Flip View** — single screenshot (`flip-view.png`) with caption about alternative parent contexts
   - **Messages** — carousel of 4 slides (`message1-4.png`) with caption about annotation messaging
   - **Example Workflow** — carousel of 3 slides (`step1-3.png`), each titled "Example Workflow: Step N — Description":
     - Step 1 — Browse a Corpus
     - Step 2 — Add an Annotation
     - Step 3 — Explore the Value Graph

**Lightbox modal:**
- Clicking any screenshot opens a lightbox overlay with the expanded image
- Lightbox displays the caption text below the image
- For carousel images (Messages, Example Workflow), the lightbox includes prev/next navigation arrows and a "N of M" indicator
- Close via × button or clicking the dark overlay background

**Constitution page content (`ConstitutionContent` component):**
- "(Tentative*)" subtitle with footnote explaining LLC status
- Bulleted list of constitutional principles (not-for-profit, privacy, human verification, transparent moderation)
- Footnote about current moderation approach (10-flag threshold, admin decisions, future Wikipedia-style deliberation)

**Comment system (shared across all info pages):**
- Comments with ▲ vote button and vote count
- 1-level nested replies (cannot reply to a reply)
- Auto-vote on comment creation (starts at 1)
- Sorted by vote count desc, then chronologically
- Guest users see comments but cannot add or vote (login prompt shown)
- 2000 character max per comment
- Optimistic vote toggling with revert on error

**Screenshot assets** (in `frontend/public/images/using-orca/`):
- `step1.png` — Corpus page with document list
- `step2.png` — Document view with annotations panel
- `step3.png` — Value hierarchy graph with child concepts and annotations
- `flip-view.png` — Flip View showing alternative parents
- `message1.png` through `message4.png` — Messaging feature screenshots

**Backend:** `pagesController.js` + `routes/pages.js`. Valid slugs hardcoded: `['using-orca', 'constitution', 'donate']`. Database tables: `page_comments`, `page_comment_votes` (see Database Schema section).

**END OF PHASE HISTORY**
