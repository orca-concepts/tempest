# ORCA - Project Status & Technical Reference

**Last Updated:** May 1, 2026 (Phase 56 informational page restructuring + final legal documents + UI polish COMPLETE. **56a:** removed Constitution and Donate pages — frontend routes, nav links, `InfoPage.jsx` PAGE_TITLES entries, and ConstitutionContent component all removed; backend `pagesController.js` `VALID_SLUGS` reduced to `['using-orca']`; one-time DELETE in `migrate.js` removed the 2 stale `page_comments` rows for `constitution`/`donate` slugs (idempotent — DELETE on missing rows is a no-op). Added new static `TheStormPage.jsx` at `/the-storm` modeled on TermsPage/PrivacyPage with no comment system. Renamed "Legal" nav link to "Legal/Copyright Info". Final nav order: The Storm → Using orca → Legal/Copyright Info. Hard-delete of pre-launch comment rows is NOT a violation of append-only — append-only governs user-generated graph content (concepts/edges/annotations/votes), not platform infrastructure decisions on test data from never-publicly-visible pages. **56b:** reordered Using orca page sections in `InfoPage.jsx`: intro → open source paragraph → YouTube video 1 placeholder → YouTube video 2 placeholder → screenshot carousels → three use cases (was: intro → use cases → open source → carousels). **56c:** YouTube link-out cards (not iframe embeds) — thumbnail card with centered play-triangle overlay, opens youtube.com in new tab via `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`. Reasoning: YouTube iframe embeds use a lower bitrate ladder than youtube.com proper, so videos look noticeably fuzzier inline. Thumbnails come from `https://img.youtube.com/vi/<VIDEO_ID>/maxresdefault.jpg` (no API key required); play triangle is pure CSS borders (no SVG, no image asset); `pointerEvents: 'none'` on overlay so clicks pass through to parent `<a>`. **56d:** final counsel-reviewed legal documents installed — full ToS, Privacy Policy, and Copyright Policy. New static `CopyrightPage.jsx` at `/copyright` (linked from `/legal` hub, replacing the prior `/copyright-policy` placeholder URL). All three pages now fetch their content from `frontend/public/legal/*.html` at runtime and render via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` — legal text lives ONLY in the public HTML files, never in `frontend/src/`, so swapping in revised counsel-reviewed wording is a one-file replacement with no JSX surgery. `CURRENT_TOS_VERSION` bumped from `'2026-04-25'` to `'1.0'` in both `backend/src/config/constants.js` and `frontend/src/config/constants.js` to mark the first real public version. **56e:** UI polish — (a) reordered attribute filter buttons on root page and other filter UIs from `All, Action, Tool, Value, Question` to `All, Value, Action, Tool, Question` (display-only; no backend changes, no `ENABLED_ATTRIBUTES` env var change); (b) renamed visible "Using Orca" label to "Using orca" (lowercase 'o') in nav link and page heading — URL slug `/using-orca` unchanged. The lowercase 'orca' styling matches the brand-voice usage in the new The Storm essay (which also uses lowercase 'orca' as a deliberate stylistic choice). Essay also shipped on `/the-storm` (replaced the placeholder paragraph from 56a with five-paragraph short essay; no Claude Code involved — direct edit of `TheStormPage.jsx`).)

**Prior Last Updated:** April 30, 2026 (Phase 55d ORCID OAuth callback back-button trap COMPLETE; Phase 55b seed `question` attribute in migrate.js COMPLETE; Phase 55a DATABASE_URL connection string for managed Postgres providers COMPLETE; Phase 54 production deployment readiness COMPLETE; Phase 53 DMCA & illegal-content removal infrastructure COMPLETE; Phase 52 data portability/correction COMPLETE; Phase 51 click-wrap consent COMPLETE.)

## Project Overview

Orca is a collaborative action ontology platform where users create and navigate hierarchical graphs of concepts with context-dependent children, community voting, and concept attributes. The initial use case is **research material** — users organize academic and scientific concepts (e.g., "Microscopy [tool]", "Cell Culture [action]", "Reproducibility [value]", "Western Blot [tool]", "Hypothesis Generation [action]", "How does institutional review board process design influence reproducibility? [question]"), annotate research documents (preprints, grant applications, outlines), and build shared ontologies for their fields. Example concepts throughout this document should reflect realistic research/academic scenarios.

**License:** AGPL v3 (GNU Affero General Public License v3.0)

**Repository:** [github.com/orca-concepts/orca](https://github.com/orca-concepts/orca) (public)

**Local working directory:** `\Users\17wil\orca\orca-public` — this is the active development folder. The private repo (`orca-private`) is retained for history but all new work happens in the public repo.

## Database Schema

### Current Tables

#### `users`
Stores user account information.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255),
  password_hash VARCHAR(255),
  phone_hash VARCHAR(255),
  phone_lookup VARCHAR(64) UNIQUE,
  orcid_id VARCHAR(19),
  token_issued_after TIMESTAMP,
  age_verified_at TIMESTAMP,
  hide_annotation_warning BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  tos_accepted_at TIMESTAMP,
  tos_version_accepted VARCHAR(32),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_users_orcid ON users(orcid_id) WHERE orcid_id IS NOT NULL;
```

**Key Points:**
- Phone numbers hashed with bcryptjs (10 salt rounds) for OTP verification during registration and password reset (Phase 32, updated Phase 40b). Passwords are the primary login mechanism.
- Username must be unique
- No concept of "ownership" - all graphs are public/collaborative
- `email` — **Re-activated in Phase 36.** Required for new registrations (enforced at application level, not DB constraint — column remains nullable for backward compatibility with existing rows). Collected at sign-up for legal notifications: copyright violation notices and ToS/privacy policy updates. Previously retired in Phase 32d; now written by `verifyRegister` endpoint. Test users backfilled with fake emails (Phase 36 migration).
- `password_hash` — **Reactivated in Phase 40b.** Stores bcrypt-hashed password (10 salt rounds). Required for new registrations. Used by `POST /auth/login` for password verification and updated by `POST /auth/forgot-password/reset`. Validated with `zxcvbn` (score >= 2, 8-128 chars). Nullable for backward compatibility — users who registered before Phase 40b may have NULL passwords (must use forgot-password flow to set one).
- `phone_hash` — bcrypt-hashed phone number for Phone OTP auth (Phase 32a). Nullable. All six test users (alice–frank) assigned fake phone hashes via Phase 32d migration. Retained for backward compatibility but no longer used for lookup (Phase 33e).
- `phone_lookup` — HMAC-SHA256 of normalized phone number, keyed by `PHONE_LOOKUP_KEY` env var (Phase 33e). Deterministic — enables O(1) database lookup via UNIQUE index. Replaces the O(n) bcrypt scan previously used for login and registration uniqueness checks.
- `token_issued_after` — timestamp used by "Log out everywhere" (Phase 32b). When set, auth middleware rejects any JWT with `iat <= token_issued_after`. Nullable — null means no sessions have been invalidated.
- `age_verified_at` — timestamp recording when the user confirmed they are at least 18 years old during registration (Phase 36). Set once at account creation, never cleared. Nullable — null for users who registered before Phase 36 (test users backfilled with `NOW()` in migration).
- `hide_annotation_warning` — boolean flag (Phase 45). When `true`, the annotation creation warning modal is suppressed for this user. Set via `POST /auth/hide-annotation-warning`. Default `false` — new users see the warning on their first annotation creation. NOT NULL.
- `tos_accepted_at` — **Added in Phase 51a.** Timestamp recording when the user ticked the click-wrap checkbox at registration. Set by `verifyRegister` to `NOW()` when `tosAccepted: true` is sent in the request body (rejected with 400 otherwise). Never cleared. Nullable for backward compatibility (existing rows backfilled with `created_at` via standalone script `backend/src/config/backfill-tos-consent.js` — NOT in `migrate.js` per Architecture Decision #271).
- `tos_version_accepted` — **Added in Phase 51a, bumped to `'1.0'` in Phase 56d.** Version string of the ToS in effect at registration time. Set by `verifyRegister` from the `tosVersion` field on the request body. The current value is hardcoded as `CURRENT_TOS_VERSION` in `backend/src/config/constants.js` and `frontend/src/config/constants.js` — bump both when ToS changes substantively. Used for future re-acceptance prompts. Nullable. Existing rows backfilled to `'pre-launch'` via the standalone backfill script. **Version history:** `'pre-launch'` (backfilled), `'2026-04-25'` (Phase 51 placeholder ToS), `'1.0'` (Phase 56d — first counsel-reviewed public version).
- `orcid_id` — verified ORCID iD in the format `0000-0000-0000-0000` (19 chars with dashes). Set via ORCID OAuth `/authenticate` flow (Phase 41a). Nullable — null for users who haven't linked an ORCID. Partial unique index (`WHERE orcid_id IS NOT NULL`) prevents two users from linking the same ORCID. Users can disconnect (set to NULL) at any time via their profile page. **Important:** Per ORCID's integration requirements, iDs must be authenticated via OAuth — users cannot manually type an ORCID iD.
- **Note:** `last_active` column was originally planned for inactive user filtering. The inactive feature was redesigned to operate at the **corpus tab level on the Saved Page** instead — see Phase 8 (Inactive Corpus Tab Dormancy, now complete). No `last_active` column is needed on the users table.

---

#### `concepts`
Stores individual concepts (nodes in the graph).

```sql
CREATE TABLE concepts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,  -- Widened from VARCHAR(40) in Phase 28g
  created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Key Points:**
- **Character limit:** Concept names are capped at 255 characters (raised from 40 in Phase 28g). Enforced at both frontend (input validation) and backend (database column + application-level check).
- Concept names are globally unique strings (enforced at application level)
- `created_by` is for provenance/moderation, not ownership
- Same concept can appear in multiple graphs with different children
- **Identity clarification:** A concept row is just a name+ID. The *contextual identity* of a concept is determined by its path + attribute. "Cardio [action]" under `Health → Fitness` is a completely different contextual entity than "Cardio [action]" under `Sports → Team Sports` — different vote counts, different children, different attributes. The concept table stores the shared name; the edges table stores the contextual identity.

---

#### `edges`
Represents parent-child relationships in specific graph contexts.

```sql
CREATE TABLE edges (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  parent_id INTEGER REFERENCES concepts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  child_id INTEGER REFERENCES concepts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  graph_path INTEGER[] NOT NULL,
  attribute_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES attributes(id),
  created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(parent_id, child_id, graph_path, attribute_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_edges_parent ON edges(parent_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_edges_child ON edges(child_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_edges_attribute ON edges(attribute_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- `graph_path` is an array of concept IDs representing the path from root to parent
- Root concepts have edges with `parent_id = NULL` and `graph_path = '{}'` (empty array) so that votes can attach to them via the unified edge model
- The same child can exist under the same parent in different graph contexts
- `UNIQUE` constraint prevents duplicate edges in the same context (note: PostgreSQL treats NULLs as distinct in unique constraints, so root edge uniqueness is enforced at the application level)
- `attribute_id` is NOT NULL — every edge must have an attribute
- Unique constraint includes `attribute_id`: same concept with different attributes in the same context = separate edges
- **Important:** When querying children, the path includes the current concept at the end
- **Important:** When querying root concepts, the WHERE clause must filter `WHERE parent_id IS NOT NULL` in the subquery to avoid excluding roots that have root edges

**Example:**
```
Graph: Root(1) → Health(2) → Exercise(3) → Cardio(4)

Edge for "Cardio under Exercise in this context":
  parent_id: 3
  child_id: 4
  graph_path: [1, 2, 3]  ← Path from root to parent
```

---

#### `votes`
User save votes on edges (parent-child relationships).

```sql
CREATE TABLE votes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, edge_id)
);
```

**Key Points:**
- One save per user per edge
- Saves are context-specific (tied to edges, not concepts)
- Save removal is implemented with cascading unsave (removing a save also removes saves on all descendant edges in that branch)
- Children are sorted by save count (descending) by default; "Sort by New" option sorts by edge `created_at` descending

---

#### `attributes` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 3)
Stores reusable attribute tags that can be applied to concepts in context.

```sql
CREATE TABLE attributes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Key Points:**
- Attributes are discrete, reusable entities (not free text or key-value pairs)
- Attributes are category labels (like "action", "tool", "value", "question") — NOT metadata fields with values (NOT `difficulty=hard`)
- Four default attributes seeded: **action**, **tool**, **value**, **question**
- **Attributes are required:** Every concept must have an attribute selected at creation time. There are no "unattributed" concepts.
- **Selection model (Phase 20a):** Users select an attribute only when creating a **root concept**. All descendant edges in the graph inherit the root edge's attribute automatically. No free-text attribute creation.
- **No user-created attributes for now.** The four released attributes are the only options. All four are enabled at launch via `ENABLED_ATTRIBUTES=value,action,tool,question`. The owner will manually add new attributes as needed by inserting rows into the `attributes` table and updating the `ENABLED_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable. The original Phase 23 (user-generated attributes) has been cancelled.
- **Immutability:** Once an attribute is assigned to an edge at creation time, it cannot be changed. The attribute becomes part of the contextual identity of that concept in that path.
- **Single-attribute graphs (Phase 20a):** Every graph has exactly one attribute, determined by the root edge. All descendant edges must match. Consistency enforced on write — backend looks up `graph_path[0]` to find the root edge's attribute and auto-assigns it.
- Same concept name with different attributes = completely separate contextual entities. "Running [action]" and "Running [tool]" share a string but are unrelated.
- **Display format (Phase 20a):** Attributes are NO LONGER shown in square brackets after every concept name. Instead, attribute badges appear in specific locations: concept page header (near breadcrumb), root page cards, Flip View cards (one per card), and annotation cards. Bracket tags were removed from child lists, search results, breadcrumbs, Saved page, diff modal, and all other locations.

#### `similarity_votes` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 4) — "Links"
Flip View votes asserting that a parent context is similar/helpful relative to the user's origin context.

```sql
CREATE TABLE similarity_votes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  origin_edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  similar_edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, origin_edge_id, similar_edge_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_similarity_votes_origin ON similarity_votes(origin_edge_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_similarity_votes_similar ON similarity_votes(similar_edge_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- Only available in contextual Flip View (entered from a specific path), not in decontextualized Flip View (from search)
- Different origin contexts have independent sets of link votes
- Helps users coming from a specific context quickly find the most relevant alternate parent paths
- `origin_edge_id` = the edge connecting the concept to the parent the user navigated from
- `similar_edge_id` = the alt parent edge the user is voting as helpful/linked
- Indexes on both `origin_edge_id` and `similar_edge_id` for fast lookups

#### `side_votes` — ❌ REMOVED (Phase 20b) — formerly "Moves"
**Dropped in Phase 20b.** Move votes were redundant with Flip View link votes. The `side_votes` table has been dropped. See Architecture Decision #152.

#### `replace_votes` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 4) — "Swaps"
User assertions that a concept should be replaced by a sibling in the same context.

```sql
CREATE TABLE replace_votes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  replacement_edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, edge_id, replacement_edge_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_replace_votes_edge ON replace_votes(edge_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_replace_votes_replacement ON replace_votes(replacement_edge_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- **Sibling-only restriction (Phase 44, reverting Phase 38c):** The replacement edge must be a sibling of the source edge — same `parent_id` and `graph_path`. For root edges, both edges must be root (`parent_id IS NULL`, empty `graph_path`) and share the same attribute. Cross-context "this concept belongs elsewhere" expression is now handled exclusively by tunneling (Phase 43). Architecture Decision #216 (Phase 38c expanded swaps) is reversed by Architecture Decision #256.
- **Auto-save on swap (Phase 44):** When a user casts a swap vote A→B, the backend automatically inserts a save vote on B if the user has not already saved it. The auto-save runs through the existing `addVote` path so Phase 20c mutual-exclusivity cascades apply normally. See Architecture Decision #257.
- Backend validates that both edges exist, are different (can't swap with self), and are siblings
- Multiple users can point to different replacements
- Visible to all users; purely informational — no automatic removal (append-only model)
- `edge_id` = the edge being flagged as replaceable
- `replacement_edge_id` = the edge that should replace it
- Indexes on both `edge_id` and `replacement_edge_id` for fast lookups
- Swap count (distinct users) returned as `swap_count` in children queries; `user_swapped` boolean returned for the current user (Phase 38b)
- **Mutual exclusivity (Phase 20c):** Save and swap are mutually exclusive per user per edge. Saving removes any existing swap; swapping removes any existing save (with cascading unsave to descendants).

---

#### `saved_tabs` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 5b) — ⚠️ WILL BE RETIRED (Phase 7c)
Stores named Saved Page tabs per user. **Note:** This table and the `vote_tab_links` junction table will be retired when Phase 7c (Saved Page Overhaul) is built. Saved tabs will be replaced by dynamically generated corpus-based tabs on a standalone Saved Page. See Phase 7c for the new design.

```sql
CREATE TABLE saved_tabs (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Saved',
  display_order INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_saved_tabs_user ON saved_tabs(user_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- Each user gets a default tab named "Saved" auto-created at registration time (can be renamed later)
- Users can create additional named tabs for organizing saves
- When saving a concept (clicking ▲), user selects which tab to save to via inline dropdown
- If only one tab exists, saves go to it automatically (no picker shown)
- `display_order` controls tab ordering in the UI
- Users cannot delete their last tab (at least one must exist)
- Deleting a tab removes its vote-tab links; votes that lose their last link are also deleted
- `group_id` is nullable — links to a `tab_groups` row if this tab is in a group, or NULL if ungrouped (Phase 5d)
- Migration backfills a default "Saved" tab for all existing users

#### `vote_tab_links` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 5b) — ⚠️ WILL BE RETIRED (Phase 7c)
Junction table linking votes to Saved tabs. A vote can appear in multiple tabs. **Note:** This table will be retired when Phase 7c (Saved Page Overhaul) is built. Save organization will be determined dynamically by corpus annotation membership instead of explicit tab links.

```sql
CREATE TABLE vote_tab_links (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  vote_id INTEGER REFERENCES votes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  saved_tab_id INTEGER REFERENCES saved_tabs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(vote_id, saved_tab_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_vote_tab_links_vote ON vote_tab_links(vote_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_vote_tab_links_tab ON vote_tab_links(saved_tab_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- A vote (user endorsement of an edge) stays unique per `(user_id, edge_id)` in the `votes` table
- The junction table says which tabs that vote appears in — purely organizational
- Same vote can be linked to multiple tabs (user saves the same concept to different tabs)
- Removing a save from a specific tab deletes the link; if no links remain, the vote itself is deleted
- ON DELETE CASCADE from both `votes` and `saved_tabs` ensures automatic cleanup
- Save counts visible to other users (`COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)` on edges) are unaffected by tabs
- Migration backfills all existing votes into each user's default tab

---

#### `graph_tabs` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 5c-1)
Persistent in-app navigation tabs for exploring the concept graph. Each graph tab tracks where the user is (concept + path + view mode).

```sql
CREATE TABLE graph_tabs (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  tab_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'root',
  concept_id INTEGER REFERENCES concepts(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  path INTEGER[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  view_mode VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'children',
  display_order INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  label VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Root',
  group_id INTEGER REFERENCES tab_groups(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_graph_tabs_user ON graph_tabs(user_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- `tab_type` is `'root'` (at root page, concept_id is null) or `'concept'` (viewing a specific concept)
- `concept_id` uses `ON DELETE SET NULL` — if a concept is removed, the tab gracefully degrades rather than being deleted
- `path` stores the graph path as an integer array (same format as edges.graph_path)
- `view_mode` is `'children'`, `'flip'`, or `'tunnel'` — persists the user's current view state. (Note: `'links'` and `'fliplinks'` were retired in Phase 27a — migration updates stale rows to `'children'`. `'tunnel'` added in Phase 43b.)
- `label` stores the display name shown in the tab bar (updated dynamically as user navigates)
- `updated_at` tracks the last navigation action (useful for ordering/recency)
- `group_id` is nullable — links to a `tab_groups` row if this tab is in a group, or NULL if ungrouped (Phase 5d)
- Graph tabs are fully persistent across sessions — survive refresh and logout/login
- No limit on number of graph tabs per user
- Graph tabs live alongside Saved tabs in a unified tab bar (AppShell) — Note: after Phase 7c, saved tabs will be replaced by corpus tabs in the main tab bar; graph tabs will then live alongside corpus tabs

---

#### `tab_groups` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 5d)
Named tab groups that can contain any combination of graph tabs (and corpus tabs after Phase 7c). Flat grouping only — no groups within groups. (Currently also supports saved tabs via `saved_tabs.group_id`, but saved tabs will leave the main tab bar in Phase 7c.)

```sql
CREATE TABLE tab_groups (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Group',
  display_order INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  is_expanded BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_tab_groups_user ON tab_groups(user_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- Each group belongs to a single user
- `is_expanded` persists the expand/collapse state of the group in the tab bar
- Groups appear in the tab bar between corpus tabs and graph tabs (currently between saved tabs and graph tabs until Phase 7c)
- Deleting a group ungroups its member tabs (sets `group_id = NULL`) — does NOT delete the tabs
- `saved_tabs.group_id` and `graph_tabs.group_id` are nullable FK references to `tab_groups(id)` with `ON DELETE SET NULL` (Note: `saved_tabs.group_id` will be retired when Phase 7c Saved Page Overhaul is built — saved tabs will leave the main tab bar; corpus tabs will get their own `group_id` FK)
- Mixed tab types allowed within a single group (currently saved + graph tabs; will become corpus + graph tabs after Phase 7c)
- Flat grouping only — groups cannot contain other groups

---

#### `saved_tree_order` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 5e) — ⚠️ LEGACY (replaced by `saved_tree_order_v2`)
Stores user-configured display order of root-level graph trees on each Saved Page tab. **Note:** This table is keyed on `saved_tab_id` which belongs to the retired manual saved tabs system. The Phase 7c Saved Page Overhaul replaced this with `saved_tree_order_v2` keyed on `corpus_id`. This table remains in the database but is no longer actively used.

```sql
CREATE TABLE saved_tree_order (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  saved_tab_id INTEGER REFERENCES saved_tabs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  root_concept_id INTEGER REFERENCES concepts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  display_order INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, saved_tab_id, root_concept_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_saved_tree_order_user_tab ON saved_tree_order(user_id, saved_tab_id);
```

---

#### `saved_tree_order_v2` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 7c Saved Page Overhaul)
Stores user-configured display order of root-level graph trees on each corpus-based Saved Page tab. Replaces `saved_tree_order` which was keyed on `saved_tab_id`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE saved_tree_order_v2 (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  corpus_id INTEGER REFERENCES corpuses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  root_concept_id INTEGER REFERENCES concepts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  display_order INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Partial unique index for rows WITH a corpus_id
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_saved_tree_order_v2_with_corpus
  ON saved_tree_order_v2(user_id, corpus_id, root_concept_id)
  WHERE corpus_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Partial unique index for rows WITHOUT a corpus_id (Uncategorized tab)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_saved_tree_order_v2_uncategorized
  ON saved_tree_order_v2(user_id, root_concept_id)
  WHERE corpus_id IS NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_saved_tree_order_v2_user_corpus
  ON saved_tree_order_v2(user_id, corpus_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- `corpus_id` is NULL for the Uncategorized tab, or references a corpus for corpus-based tabs
- Uses PostgreSQL partial unique indexes to handle the NULL vs non-NULL corpus_id cases separately
- Trees without an explicit order record fall to the bottom, sorted by save count as before
- Reordering is via up/down arrow buttons on each root tree card (same UI as before)
- Order persists between sessions
- Each corpus tab (and the uncategorized tab) has its own independent ordering

---

#### `child_rankings` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 5f) — 💤 DORMANT (Phase 28b)
Stores per-user numeric rankings of children when filtering to a single identical vote set. **Retired in Phase 28b** — the ranking UI (dropdown, aggregated rank badges) is removed from the frontend. Table remains in database (append-only philosophy).

```sql
CREATE TABLE child_rankings (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  parent_edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  child_edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  vote_set_key TEXT NOT NULL,
  rank_position INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, parent_edge_id, child_edge_id, vote_set_key)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_child_rankings_parent_set ON child_rankings(parent_edge_id, vote_set_key);
```

**Key Points:**
- `parent_edge_id` identifies the parent context where the children are being ranked (the edge connecting the current concept to its parent)
- `child_edge_id` is the specific child being ranked
- `vote_set_key` is a deterministic string identifying the identical vote set (sorted comma-separated edge IDs). This ties rankings to a specific vote set composition — if set membership changes, it's a new key and old rankings don't apply
- `rank_position` is the user-assigned number (1, 2, 3…)
- Rankings are only visible when filtering to a **single** identical vote set (not multi-select, not super-groups)
- Only the user's own vote set can be ranked (backend validates user has a vote on the parent edge); other sets show aggregated rankings read-only
- Aggregated display: for each child, show the count of users who assigned each rank number; sort children by the most popular rank (rank with the highest count wins; ties broken by overall save count)
- Unranked children (no `child_rankings` row for a user) appear at the bottom of the filtered view
- If a user unsaves a child (leaves the vote set), their `child_rankings` rows for that child are cleaned up automatically
- Single-user vote sets: the aggregated view just shows the user's own ordering

#### `concept_links` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 6, updated Phase 29a)
External URLs attached to concepts in specific contexts (tied to edges).

```sql
CREATE TABLE concept_links (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  url TEXT NOT NULL,
  title VARCHAR(255),
  comment TEXT,                                    -- Phase 29a: optional creator comment
  added_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP   -- Phase 29a: tracks comment edit time
);

CREATE INDEX idx_concept_links_edge ON concept_links(edge_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- Web links are context-specific (tied to an edge, not a concept globally)
- Same concept can have different web links in different parent contexts
- URL validated to start with `http://` or `https://`, max 2048 characters
- Duplicate URLs on the same edge are rejected (409 Conflict)
- Only the user who added a link can remove it
- Auto-upvoted by the user who adds the link
- Web links appear on the Annotations & Links panel (right column of concept page, Phase 27a)
- Cross-context compilation available via the Web Links tab in the ConceptAnnotationPanel
- **Creator comments (Phase 29a):** Optional `comment` field stored on the link. Only the creator (`added_by`) can edit their comment via `PUT /web-links/:linkId/comment`. The `updated_at` column tracks when the comment was last modified; "(edited)" indicator shows in the UI when `updated_at` differs from `created_at`. First-time comment additions do NOT update `updated_at` — only subsequent edits do, so "(edited)" only appears for genuine modifications.
- **Inline add form (Phase 29a):** "+ Add Web Link" button in the Web Links tab opens an inline form with URL, optional title, and optional comment fields
- **Clickable vote toggle (Phase 29a):** The vote count on each web link is clickable to toggle the user's vote; links re-sort by vote count after each toggle

#### `concept_link_votes` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 6)
Simple upvote system for web links attached to concepts.

```sql
CREATE TABLE concept_link_votes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  concept_link_id INTEGER REFERENCES concept_links(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, concept_link_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_concept_link_votes_link ON concept_link_votes(concept_link_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- One upvote per user per web link (simple endorsement, not the four-type vote system used for edges)
- `UNIQUE(user_id, concept_link_id)` prevents double-voting
- ON DELETE CASCADE from both `users` and `concept_links` ensures cleanup
- Vote count computed as `COUNT(*)` on `concept_link_votes` for each link

---

#### `corpuses` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 7a)
Named collections of documents. Annotations, permissions, and subscriptions all operate at the corpus level.

```sql
CREATE TABLE corpuses (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  annotation_mode VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'public',
  created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_corpuses_created_by ON corpuses(created_by);
```

**Key Points:**
- `annotation_mode` is currently `'public'` or `'private'` — **this column will be retired in Phase 7g** when the combined public/private model replaces the binary toggle. All corpuses will have both layers.
- `parent_corpus_id` was removed in Phase 19a — sub-corpus infrastructure removed entirely. All corpuses are now top-level.
- `description` is optional free-text explaining the corpus's purpose
- Only the owner (`created_by`) can update, delete, add/remove documents
- **Unique name:** Corpus names are unique (case-insensitive). Creating or renaming a corpus to an existing name returns 409 Conflict.
- Deleting a corpus cascades to `corpus_documents` rows; documents orphaned (in zero corpuses) are also deleted UNLESS uploaded by an allowed user — those are left orphaned for the author to rescue (Phase 9b)

#### `documents` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 7a, extended Phase 7h, Phase 25a)
Stores uploaded document content. Documents are immutable once finalized — text content cannot be edited after finalization.

```sql
CREATE TABLE documents (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  format VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'plain',
  uploaded_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  version_number INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  source_document_id INTEGER REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  tag_id INTEGER REFERENCES document_tags(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  copyright_confirmed_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_documents_uploaded_by ON documents(uploaded_by);
CREATE INDEX idx_documents_source ON documents(source_document_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- `format` is `'plain'`, `'markdown'`, `'pdf'`, or `'docx'` — determines rendering in the document viewer. Phase 22a adds pdf and docx support via server-side text extraction (`pdf-parse` and `mammoth` libraries).
- `body` stores the full text content; character offsets for annotations (Phase 7d) depend on immutability after finalization
- **Unique title:** Document titles are unique (case-insensitive). Uploading a document with an existing title returns 409 Conflict.
- Documents are never manually deleted — their lifecycle is governed entirely by corpus membership
- A document is auto-deleted only when it's removed from its last corpus (orphan cleanup), UNLESS uploaded by an allowed user of that corpus — those are left orphaned for the author to rescue (Phase 9b)
- **Phase 7h versioning columns:**
  - `version_number` — auto-incremented per lineage (default 1 for original uploads)
  - `source_document_id` — self-referencing FK forming a version chain (NULL for originals, points to the immediate predecessor for versions). `ON DELETE SET NULL` so chain survives if a middle version is somehow removed.
- **Phase 25a tag column:**
  - `tag_id` — nullable FK to `document_tags`. Replaces the former `document_tag_links` junction table. Only the document uploader (`uploaded_by`) can assign or change the tag.
  - **Version chain propagation:** Assigning or removing a tag uses a recursive CTE to walk the full version chain (up via `source_document_id` to root, then back down) and updates `tag_id` on all versions simultaneously.
  - New versions inherit the source document's `tag_id` automatically via `createVersion`.
- **Phase 36 copyright confirmation column:**
  - `copyright_confirmed_at` — timestamp recording when the uploader confirmed they have the right to upload the content (owns it or it is public domain). Set per document at upload time. Required for both original uploads and version uploads. Nullable — null for documents uploaded before Phase 36.
- **LEFT JOIN requirement for `uploaded_by` (Phase 36 bug fix):** Because `uploaded_by` uses `ON DELETE SET NULL` (Phase 35c), it becomes NULL when the uploading user deletes their account. Any query that JOINs `users` via `uploaded_by` **must** use `LEFT JOIN`, not inner JOIN — otherwise the document silently disappears from results. This applies to all provenance FKs changed by Phase 35c (`created_by`, `added_by`, `uploaded_by`, etc.).
- **File upload model (Phase 22a):** Documents are created by uploading files (.txt, .md, .pdf, .docx) or via drag-and-drop. There is no in-app text editor. Text is extracted server-side from uploaded files using `pdf-parse` (PDFs) and `mammoth` (Word docs). The `format` column stores the original file type. Document updates happen by uploading a new version (version chain via `source_document_id`), not by editing the body in-place.
- **Edit endpoint retired (Phase 22a):** The `POST /api/corpuses/documents/:id/edit` endpoint and `adjustAnnotationOffsets` helper from Phase 21a are removed. The `diff-match-patch` dependency is also removed. Since documents can no longer be edited in-place, annotation offset adjustment is no longer needed — annotations remain stable against the uploaded text. Document "editing" is now accomplished by creating a new version.

#### `corpus_documents` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 7a)
Junction table linking documents to corpuses. A document can appear in multiple corpuses.

```sql
CREATE TABLE corpus_documents (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  corpus_id INTEGER REFERENCES corpuses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  document_id INTEGER REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  added_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(corpus_id, document_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_corpus_documents_corpus ON corpus_documents(corpus_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_corpus_documents_document ON corpus_documents(document_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- `UNIQUE(corpus_id, document_id)` prevents the same document being added to the same corpus twice
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from both `corpuses` and `documents` ensures cleanup
- `added_by` tracks who added the document to this specific corpus (may differ from who uploaded the document)
- Removing a document from a corpus checks if it's orphaned and auto-deletes if so

#### `corpus_subscriptions` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 7c)
Tracks which users are subscribed to which corpuses. Subscribing creates a persistent corpus tab in the main tab bar.

```sql
CREATE TABLE corpus_subscriptions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  corpus_id INTEGER REFERENCES corpuses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, corpus_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_corpus_subscriptions_user ON corpus_subscriptions(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_corpus_subscriptions_corpus ON corpus_subscriptions(corpus_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- `UNIQUE(user_id, corpus_id)` prevents duplicate subscriptions
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from both `users` and `corpuses` ensures cleanup
- Subscribing creates a persistent corpus tab in the sidebar and a row in `sidebar_items`; unsubscribing removes both
- Subscriber count is displayed on corpus listings and corpus detail views
- Corpus deletion cascades to subscriptions automatically
- `group_id` column was removed in Phase 19d — corpus tabs are no longer placed in flat tab groups. Sidebar ordering is handled by the `sidebar_items` table.

#### `document_annotations` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 7d, redesigned Phase 22b)
Annotations attach an edge (concept-in-context) to a document, scoped to a specific corpus. The same document in different corpuses has entirely separate annotation sets. Annotations are document-level — they connect a concept to the whole document, with an optional text quote and optional freeform comment.

```sql
CREATE TABLE document_annotations (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  corpus_id INTEGER REFERENCES corpuses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  document_id INTEGER REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  quote_text TEXT,
  comment TEXT,
  quote_occurrence INTEGER,
  layer VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'public',
  created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_document_annotations_corpus_doc ON document_annotations(corpus_id, document_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_document_annotations_edge ON document_annotations(edge_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_document_annotations_document ON document_annotations(document_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- `corpus_id` + `document_id` scopes annotations to a specific corpus — same document in different corpuses has separate annotations
- `edge_id` links the annotation to a concept-in-context (specific path + attribute)
- `quote_text` — optional string quoted from the document. Stored as plain text, not character offsets. Used for click-to-navigate via runtime string search.
- `comment` — optional freeform text explaining the connection (e.g., "Section 3 discusses why their protocol improved reproducibility")
- `quote_occurrence` — optional 1-indexed integer indicating which occurrence of the quote string in the document the annotator selected. Stored when the quote appears multiple times.
- `layer` column is `VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'public'` — **functionally retired (Phase 26c).** The column remains in the database (append-only philosophy) and new annotations harmlessly default to `'public'`, but the value is ignored by the filter system. Filtering is now identity-based (Phase 26d) — see `getDocumentAnnotations` query parameter `?filter=all|corpus_members|author`.
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from all three FKs (corpus, document, edge) ensures automatic cleanup
- Three indexes for fast lookups: by corpus+document (loading annotations for a document view), by edge (bidirectional linking on External Links page), by document (cross-corpus annotation queries)
- **Phase 22b migration:** Existing offset-based annotations were migrated by extracting `SUBSTRING(body, start_position + 1, end_position - start_position)` into `quote_text`. The `start_position`, `end_position` columns and `valid_positions` CHECK constraint were dropped.
- **Annotations are permanent (Phase 26c):** Annotations cannot be deleted. Quality is curated through voting — low-quality annotations sink to the bottom. The `POST /annotations/delete` endpoint returns 410 Gone.
- **Auto-vote on creation (Phase 26c):** Creating an annotation automatically inserts a vote in `annotation_votes` for the creator, so every annotation starts with vote_count = 1.

#### `annotation_votes` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 7f)
Simple endorsement votes on annotations. One vote per user per annotation.

```sql
CREATE TABLE annotation_votes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  annotation_id INTEGER REFERENCES document_annotations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, annotation_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_annotation_votes_annotation ON annotation_votes(annotation_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- One endorsement per user per annotation
- `UNIQUE(user_id, annotation_id)` prevents double-voting
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from both `users` and `document_annotations` ensures cleanup
- Vote count computed as `COUNT(*)` on `annotation_votes` for each annotation
- Returned alongside annotation data in `getDocumentAnnotations` query (as `vote_count` and `user_voted`)
- **Auto-vote on creation (Phase 26c):** When an annotation is created, a vote is automatically inserted for the creator. The creator can later remove their vote if they change their mind — the annotation itself remains (permanence).
- **No editorial-layer voting restriction (Phase 26c):** Any logged-in user can vote on any annotation regardless of corpus membership or authorship status.

#### `annotation_color_set_votes` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 7f) — 💤 DORMANT (Phase 26c)
Stores a user's preferred vote set (color set) for a given annotation's concept's children. **Retired in Phase 26c** — all color set voting endpoints return 410 Gone and the frontend UI has been removed. Table remains in database (append-only philosophy).

```sql
CREATE TABLE annotation_color_set_votes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  annotation_id INTEGER REFERENCES document_annotations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  vote_set_key TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, annotation_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_annotation_color_set_votes_annotation ON annotation_color_set_votes(annotation_id);
```

---

#### `corpus_allowed_users` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 7g, updated Phase 26b)
Tracks which users are allowed to contribute to a corpus. The corpus owner invites users via invite tokens. Used for "Corpus Members" identity resolution in the annotation filter system (Phase 26d).

```sql
CREATE TABLE corpus_allowed_users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  corpus_id INTEGER REFERENCES corpuses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  display_name VARCHAR(255),
  invited_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(corpus_id, user_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_corpus_allowed_users_corpus ON corpus_allowed_users(corpus_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_corpus_allowed_users_user ON corpus_allowed_users(user_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- `UNIQUE(corpus_id, user_id)` prevents duplicate allowed-user entries
- `display_name` column is **dormant (Phase 26b)** — remains in database but is no longer read or written. The `POST /allowed-users/display-name` endpoint returns 410 Gone.
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from both `corpuses` and `users` ensures cleanup
- The corpus owner is implicitly a corpus member (checked by ownership, not by presence in this table)
- **UI (Phase 26b, updated Phase 28e):** All corpus members (owner AND allowed users) can see each other's usernames in the members panel. Invite link generation and member removal remain owner-only. Members can self-remove via "Leave corpus" button. Non-members see count only ("N corpus members").
- **Identity resolution (Phase 26d):** Corpus members = `corpuses.created_by` UNION `corpus_allowed_users.user_id`. Used for the `?filter=corpus_members` annotation filter and `addedByCorpusMember`/`votedByCorpusMember` provenance badges.

#### `corpus_invite_tokens` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 7g)
Stores invite tokens generated by corpus owners. Each token is a unique random string. Accepting a token adds the user to `corpus_allowed_users`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE corpus_invite_tokens (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  corpus_id INTEGER REFERENCES corpuses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  token VARCHAR(64) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  max_uses INTEGER,
  use_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE INDEX idx_corpus_invite_tokens_corpus ON corpus_invite_tokens(corpus_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_corpus_invite_tokens_token ON corpus_invite_tokens(token);
```

**Key Points:**
- `token` is a 48-character URL-safe random string generated via `crypto.randomBytes`
- `expires_at` is optional — if set, the token becomes invalid after this time
- `max_uses` is optional — if set, the token becomes invalid after reaching this count
- `use_count` is incremented on each successful acceptance
- Tokens are accepted via `POST /corpuses/invite/accept` and the frontend route `/invite/:token`

#### `annotation_removal_log` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 7g, updated Phase 22b) — 💤 DORMANT (Phase 26c)
Logs every annotation removal performed by a non-creator. **Retired in Phase 26c** — annotations can no longer be deleted, so no new entries will be written. The `GET /:corpusId/removal-log` endpoint returns 410 Gone and the frontend removal log panel has been removed. Table remains in database with historical entries (append-only philosophy).

```sql
CREATE TABLE annotation_removal_log (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  corpus_id INTEGER REFERENCES corpuses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  document_id INTEGER REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  start_position INTEGER,
  end_position INTEGER,
  quote_text TEXT,
  annotation_layer VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'public',
  original_creator INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  removed_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  removed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_annotation_removal_log_corpus ON annotation_removal_log(corpus_id);
```

#### `document_annotations.layer` column — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 7g) — 💤 FUNCTIONALLY RETIRED (Phase 26c/26d)
Layer column is included in the `document_annotations` CREATE TABLE above (Phase 22b consolidated it).

**Key Points:**
- Column retained in database with `NOT NULL DEFAULT 'public'` — new annotations harmlessly get `'public'`, but the value is ignored.
- **Replaced by identity-based filtering (Phase 26d):** The `getDocumentAnnotations` endpoint now accepts `?filter=all|corpus_members|author` instead of `?layer=public|editorial|author`. Filter views are computed at query time from user identities (authors = uploader + `document_authors`; corpus members = corpus owner + `corpus_allowed_users`).
- **Author filter (Phase 26d):** Returns annotations where the creator is an author (uploader or co-author via `document_authors`) OR any author has voted for the annotation.
- **Corpus Members filter (Phase 26d):** Returns annotations where the creator is a corpus member (owner or in `corpus_allowed_users`) OR any corpus member has voted for it.
- **All filter (Phase 26d, default):** Returns ALL annotations with four provenance badges: `addedByAuthor`, `votedByAuthor`, `addedByCorpusMember`, `votedByCorpusMember`.
- All annotations are visible to all users in the All view — the old restriction hiding editorial annotations from non-allowed users is removed.
- The old `annotation_mode` column on `corpuses` is functionally retired — it still exists in the database but is no longer used for permission checks.

#### `document_authors` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 26a)
Tracks co-authors of a document. Co-authorship is stored at the version-chain level — `document_id` references the root document (where `source_document_id IS NULL`), and the co-author group applies to all versions in the lineage.

```sql
CREATE TABLE document_authors (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  document_id INTEGER REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  invited_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(document_id, user_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_document_authors_document ON document_authors(document_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_document_authors_user ON document_authors(user_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- `document_id` references the **root document** in the version chain. When checking co-author status for any version, the backend walks up the `source_document_id` chain via recursive CTE (`getRootDocumentId`) to find the root, then checks this table.
- The original uploader (`documents.uploaded_by`) is implicitly an author — not stored in `document_authors`, checked by ownership (same pattern as corpus owner vs `corpus_allowed_users`).
- Any author (uploader or co-author) can: generate invite tokens, remove other co-authors, create new versions.
- Co-authors can self-remove via the "Leave" endpoint (uploader cannot leave).
- **Identity resolution (Phase 26d):** Authors = `documents.uploaded_by` (root doc) UNION `document_authors.user_id`. Used for the `?filter=author` annotation filter and `addedByAuthor`/`votedByAuthor` provenance badges.
- **Promotion behavior:** When a user becomes a co-author, their existing annotations and votes on that document automatically appear in the Author filter — no data migration needed (query-time computation).

#### `document_invite_tokens` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 26a)
Stores invite tokens for document co-authorship. Modeled identically to `corpus_invite_tokens` but with `document_id` instead of `corpus_id`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE document_invite_tokens (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  document_id INTEGER REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  token VARCHAR(64) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  max_uses INTEGER,
  use_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE INDEX idx_document_invite_tokens_document ON document_invite_tokens(document_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_document_invite_tokens_token ON document_invite_tokens(token);
```

**Key Points:**
- `document_id` references the root document in the version chain (same as `document_authors`).
- `token` is a 48-character URL-safe random string generated via `crypto.randomBytes(36).toString('base64url')`.
- Any author (uploader or co-author) can generate tokens.
- Accepting a token adds the user to `document_authors` for the root document.
- Frontend acceptance route: `/doc-invite/:token` → `DocInviteAccept` component.

#### `document_concept_links_cache` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 7i-5)
Pre-computed concept link matches for finalized documents. Since finalized document bodies are immutable, matches only change when new concepts are created.

```sql
CREATE TABLE document_concept_links_cache (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  document_id INTEGER REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  concept_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  concept_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,  -- Widened from VARCHAR(40) in Phase 28g
  start_position INTEGER NOT NULL,
  end_position INTEGER NOT NULL,
  computed_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_doc_concept_links_cache_doc ON document_concept_links_cache(document_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- All cached entries for a document share the same `computed_at` timestamp
- On document open, the backend compares `computed_at` against `MAX(concepts.created_at)` — if any concepts were created after the cache was built, the cache is stale and recomputed
- Cache is replaced atomically (DELETE + INSERT in a transaction) when recomputing
- First view of a document after deployment (or after new concepts are created) triggers computation; subsequent views serve from cache
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from `documents` ensures cleanup when documents are removed
- **Phase 22b repurposing:** Cache now feeds the "Concepts in this document" sidebar panel instead of rendering persistent underlines in the document body. Same data, different consumer.

---

#### `document_favorites` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Post-Phase 7 cleanup)
Per-corpus document favoriting. Users can favorite documents within a specific corpus to float them to the top of that corpus's document list. Favoriting in one corpus does not affect the document's position in other corpuses.

```sql
CREATE TABLE document_favorites (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  corpus_id INTEGER REFERENCES corpuses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  document_id INTEGER REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, corpus_id, document_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_document_favorites_user_corpus ON document_favorites(user_id, corpus_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- `UNIQUE(user_id, corpus_id, document_id)` — one favorite per user per document per corpus
- Per-corpus: favoriting a document in Corpus A doesn't affect its position in Corpus B
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from all three FKs ensures cleanup
- Favorited documents sort to the top of the document list in `CorpusTabContent`
- Toggle endpoint: `POST /corpuses/documents/favorite/toggle` — inserts if not favorited, deletes if already favorited
- Star button (☆/★) appears on each document card for logged-in users; guests see no star
- Warm amber color (goldenrod) for the filled star, consistent with Orca's design language

---

#### `saved_page_tab_activity` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 8)
Tracks when each corpus tab on the Saved Page was last opened, used to determine dormancy. A background job (`check-dormancy.js`) marks tabs dormant after 30 days of inactivity.

```sql
CREATE TABLE saved_page_tab_activity (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  corpus_id INTEGER REFERENCES corpuses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  last_opened_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  is_dormant BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  UNIQUE(user_id, corpus_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_saved_page_tab_activity_user ON saved_page_tab_activity(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_saved_page_tab_activity_dormant ON saved_page_tab_activity(user_id, is_dormant);

-- Partial unique index for NULL corpus_id (Uncategorized tab)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_saved_page_tab_activity_uncategorized
  ON saved_page_tab_activity(user_id)
  WHERE corpus_id IS NULL;
```

**Key Points:**
- `corpus_id` references the corpus whose Saved Page tab is being tracked; NULL for the "Uncategorized" tab
- `last_opened_at` updated whenever a user switches to / opens a corpus tab on the Saved Page
- `is_dormant` set to `true` by the `check-dormancy.js` background job when `last_opened_at` is older than 30 days
- **Simplified dormancy model (Architecture Decision #43):** A user's votes are excluded from ALL public save totals only when EVERY one of that user's `saved_page_tab_activity` rows has `is_dormant = true`. If even one tab is active, all votes count everywhere. This avoids per-edge, per-corpus filtering complexity.
- Users with zero activity rows (never opened Saved Page) are NOT dormant — their votes always count
- Only save votes are affected — swap and link votes are independent and remain unaffected
- On clicking a dormant tab, user sees a modal with two options: "Revive my votes" or "View without reviving"
- "Revive" sets `is_dormant = false`, updates `last_opened_at`, and triggers a data reload so save totals reflect the change
- "View without reviving" allows read-only browsing; votes stay dormant; a persistent info bar offers a "Revive" button
- Modal messaging is context-aware: if all tabs are dormant, it says votes aren't being counted; if only some tabs are dormant, it clarifies votes still count because of other active tabs
- Migration backfills activity rows for all existing users with `last_opened_at = NOW()` so nobody is instantly dormant on deploy
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from both `users` and `corpuses` ensures cleanup
- PostgreSQL `NULL::INTEGER` cast required in backfill INSERT for the uncategorized tab (bare `NULL` causes type inference error)

#### `user_corpus_tab_placements` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 12c)
Allows users to place their graph tabs inside any corpus node in the sidebar directory tree. These placements are private — only visible to the placing user.

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_corpus_tab_placements (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  graph_tab_id INTEGER REFERENCES graph_tabs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  corpus_id INTEGER REFERENCES corpuses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  display_order INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, graph_tab_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_user_corpus_tab_placements_user_corpus
  ON user_corpus_tab_placements(user_id, corpus_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- `UNIQUE(user_id, graph_tab_id)` — a graph tab can only be placed in one corpus at a time per user
- Placing a graph tab in a corpus removes it from any flat tab group (sets `graph_tabs.group_id = NULL`)
- Conversely, adding a graph tab to a flat group removes its corpus placement
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from all three FKs ensures cleanup
- Placed graph tabs appear indented under their corpus in the sidebar tree
- Other users cannot see anyone else's graph tab placements

---

### Planned Tables

#### `concept_flags` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 16a, updated Phase 30k)
Spam/moderation flags on edges. 10 flags = hide (changed from single-flag-hides in Phase 30k).

```sql
CREATE TABLE concept_flags (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  reason VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'spam',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, edge_id)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_concept_flags_edge ON concept_flags(edge_id);
```

#### `concept_flag_votes` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 16a)
Community votes to keep hidden or restore flagged concepts.

```sql
CREATE TABLE concept_flag_votes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  vote_type VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL CHECK (vote_type IN ('hide', 'show')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, edge_id)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_concept_flag_votes_edge ON concept_flag_votes(edge_id);
```

#### `moderation_comments` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 16a)
Discussion comments on hidden/flagged concepts.

```sql
CREATE TABLE moderation_comments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
CREATE INDEX idx_moderation_comments_edge ON moderation_comments(edge_id);
```

#### `edges.is_hidden` column — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 16a)
```sql
ALTER TABLE edges ADD COLUMN is_hidden BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
```

#### `document_tags` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 17a), updated Phase 27e (planned)
Admin-controlled tags for categorizing documents (preprint, outline, grant application, protocol, etc.). Originally user-generated (Phase 17a); Phase 27e shifts to owner-controlled model mirroring the attribute system.

```sql
CREATE TABLE document_tags (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Key Points:**
- Tag names are unique (case-insensitive, enforced at application level via exact match against `ENABLED_DOCUMENT_TAGS` env var values, plus `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_document_tags_name_lower ON document_tags (LOWER(name))` added in Phase 28d to prevent future case-variant duplicates at the database level)
- **Phase 27e (planned):** Tags shift from user-generated to admin-controlled. The `ENABLED_DOCUMENT_TAGS` environment variable gates which tags appear in the picker (comma-separated names, same pattern as `ENABLED_ATTRIBUTES`). The `POST /documents/tags/create` endpoint is retired (410 Gone). New tags are added by the owner via database row insertion + env var update + restart. The `created_by` column remains for provenance but no new rows are created through the API.
- Tags are shared globally across all documents and corpuses
- **Phase 28d fix:** `listDocumentTags` changed from case-insensitive `LOWER()` matching to exact match (`dt.name IN ($1, ...)`) against env var values. Migration deletes the "PrePrint" duplicate tag and its links.

#### `document_tag_links` — ❌ DROPPED (Phase 25a)
Junction table that formerly linked documents to tags. **Dropped in Phase 25a** — replaced by a direct `tag_id` column on the `documents` table (single tag per document). Migration copied the earliest assigned tag per document before dropping the table.

**Historical schema (for reference):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE document_tag_links (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  document_id INTEGER REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  tag_id INTEGER REFERENCES document_tags(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  added_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(document_id, tag_id)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_document_tag_links_doc ON document_tag_links(document_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_document_tag_links_tag ON document_tag_links(tag_id);
```

**Key Points (historical):**
- A tag can be assigned to the same document only once (`UNIQUE(document_id, tag_id)`)
- `added_by` tracks who assigned the tag — used for permission checks on removal
- Removal permission: the user who assigned the tag OR any owner of a corpus containing the document
- **Dropped in Phase 25a:** Replaced by `documents.tag_id` direct column. Only the document uploader can assign/change the tag. Tag assignment/removal propagates across the full version chain via recursive CTE.

### Planned Tables

#### `sidebar_items` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 19b)
Unified ordering for all sidebar items (corpuses, groups, loose graph tabs). Replaces the separate `display_order` fields that existed on individual tables.

```sql
CREATE TABLE sidebar_items (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  item_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'corpus', 'group', or 'graph_tab'
  item_id INTEGER NOT NULL,       -- references corpus_subscriptions.id, tab_groups.id, or graph_tabs.id
  display_order INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  UNIQUE(user_id, item_type, item_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_sidebar_items_user ON sidebar_items(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_sidebar_items_user_order ON sidebar_items(user_id, display_order);
```

**Key Points:**
- `item_type` + `item_id` together identify the sidebar item — no single FK (polymorphic reference)
- `display_order` controls the unified order of all items in the sidebar
- Migration backfills from current positions: corpuses first, then groups, then loose graph tabs
- When a new corpus subscription or graph tab is created, a `sidebar_items` row is auto-created at the bottom
- When a subscription or tab is deleted, the corresponding `sidebar_items` row is cleaned up
- Graph tabs inside a corpus or group are NOT in `sidebar_items` — they appear nested under their container. Only top-level items get rows.

#### `user_default_attributes` — ❌ CANCELLED (Phase 23 cancelled)
Per-user configured default attributes shown at concept creation time. **No longer planned** — attribute enablement is now controlled by the app owner via `ENABLED_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable (Phase 25e).

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_default_attributes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  attribute_id INTEGER REFERENCES attributes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  display_order INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  UNIQUE(user_id, attribute_id)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_default_attributes_user ON user_default_attributes(user_id);
```

#### `vote_set_changes` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 23a)
Append-only event log tracking save/unsave actions for vote set drift analysis.

```sql
CREATE TABLE vote_set_changes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  parent_edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  child_edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  action VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL CHECK (action IN ('save', 'unsave')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
CREATE INDEX idx_vote_set_changes_parent_user_time ON vote_set_changes(parent_edge_id, user_id, created_at);
```

**Key Points:**
- Append-only — no unique constraint, no updates, no deletes. Every save/unsave event is a new row.
- `parent_edge_id` is the edge whose children list is affected (NULL for root-level saves where the saved edge itself is a root edge)
- `child_edge_id` is the specific child edge being saved or unsaved
- Logging wired into `addVote` (saves), `removeVote` (unsaves including cascading descendants), and `addSwapVote` (cascade removal from Phase 20c mutual exclusivity)
- `addVote` uses indexed loop: `parent_edge_id = edgeIdsToSave[i-1]` (NULL at index 0 for root edge). Only logs when INSERT actually creates a new vote.
- `removeVote` uses LEFT JOIN to map each removed edge to its parent edge, then bulk-inserts 'unsave' events via `unnest`
- No background jobs — reconstruction queries replay events on demand
- Data accumulates from the moment of deployment; pre-deployment saves have no log entries

#### `page_comments`
Stores comments on the Using Orca informational page. Supports 1-level nesting via `parent_comment_id`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE page_comments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  page_slug VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  parent_comment_id INTEGER REFERENCES page_comments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
CREATE INDEX idx_page_comments_page ON page_comments(page_slug);
CREATE INDEX idx_page_comments_parent ON page_comments(parent_comment_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- `page_slug` whitelist enforced at the backend (`VALID_SLUGS` in `pagesController.js`): currently only `using-orca`. Constitution and Donate slugs were removed in Phase 56a along with the pages themselves; their stale rows were hard-deleted via a one-time DELETE in `migrate.js`. (This hard-delete is not a violation of append-only — append-only governs user-generated graph content, not platform infrastructure decisions on pre-launch test data.)
- `parent_comment_id` enables 1-level nested replies (cannot reply to a reply — backend enforces)
- Comments sorted by vote count desc, then chronologically
- The Storm page (Phase 56a) is a static page with no comment system — it does not use this table.

#### `page_comment_votes`
Tracks upvotes on page comments. Toggle-based (add/remove). Auto-vote on comment creation.

```sql
CREATE TABLE page_comment_votes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  comment_id INTEGER REFERENCES page_comments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, comment_id)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_page_comment_votes_comment ON page_comment_votes(comment_id);
```

#### `document_citation_links` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 38j)
Stores detected annotation citation URLs found in uploaded documents. When a document body contains an Orca citation URL (`cite/a/{annotationId}`), a row is created linking the citing document to the cited annotation with snapshot metadata for dead-link resilience.

```sql
CREATE TABLE document_citation_links (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  citing_document_id INTEGER REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  cited_annotation_id INTEGER REFERENCES document_annotations(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  citation_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  snapshot_concept_name VARCHAR(255),
  snapshot_quote_text TEXT,
  snapshot_document_title VARCHAR(500),
  snapshot_corpus_name VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_citation_links_citing_doc ON document_citation_links(citing_document_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_citation_links_cited_annotation ON document_citation_links(cited_annotation_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- `cited_annotation_id` uses `ON DELETE SET NULL` — when the cited annotation is deleted (e.g., via document deletion cascade), the citation row survives with snapshot fields intact
- Detection happens at upload time (`uploadDocument`) and version upload time (`createVersion`) only — no re-scanning
- Citation URLs are plain format: `{origin}/cite/a/{annotationId}`
- Snapshot metadata (`snapshot_concept_name`, `snapshot_quote_text`, `snapshot_document_title`, `snapshot_corpus_name`) stored at detection time for dead-link resilience
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from `citing_document_id` ensures cleanup when the citing document is deleted

#### `document_external_links` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 41c)
External source URLs (arXiv links, DOIs, journal URLs) attached to documents. Links are stored against the **root document** in the version chain — all versions share one set of links, with no propagation needed (same pattern as `document_authors`).

```sql
CREATE TABLE document_external_links (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  document_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  url TEXT NOT NULL,
  added_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_document_external_links_doc ON document_external_links(document_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- `document_id` references the **root document** in the version chain. When adding/removing/querying links for any version, the backend walks up via `getRootDocumentId()` to find the root, then operates on that ID. All versions in the lineage automatically see the same links.
- Multiple links per document — a paper can have both an arXiv link and a DOI, for example
- `added_by` uses `ON DELETE SET NULL` — links survive if the adding user deletes their account
- Duplicate URL check: same URL on the same root document returns 409 Conflict
- URL validation: must start with `http://` or `https://`, max 2000 characters
- Permission: only document authors (uploader or `document_authors` members) can add or remove links
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from `document_id` ensures cleanup when the root document is deleted
- Links displayed at the top of the document viewer in `CorpusTabContent`, below the title/metadata bar

#### `combos` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 39a)
User-created collections of edges (concepts-in-context) from across the graph system. Combos group related concepts from different graphs and attributes, presenting a unified view of all annotations attached to those edges.

```sql
CREATE TABLE combos (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_combos_name_lower ON combos (LOWER(name));
CREATE INDEX idx_combos_created_by ON combos(created_by);
```

**Key Points:**
- Combo names are unique (case-insensitive), enforced by the unique index on `LOWER(name)` — same pattern as corpuses
- `description` is optional free-text explaining the combo's purpose
- Only the owner (`created_by`) can add/remove edges from the combo
- **Combos cannot be deleted** — consistent with Orca's append-only philosophy
- `created_by` uses `ON DELETE SET NULL` (Phase 39e) — if the owner deletes their account, the combo persists with `created_by = NULL` (ownerless). No one can add/remove edges, but subscribers can still view it. Frontend shows "[deleted user]".

#### `combo_edges` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 39a)
Junction table linking combos to edges (concepts-in-context). A combo contains one or more edges; the same edge can appear in multiple combos.

```sql
CREATE TABLE combo_edges (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  combo_id INTEGER REFERENCES combos(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  added_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(combo_id, edge_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_combo_edges_combo ON combo_edges(combo_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_combo_edges_edge ON combo_edges(edge_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- `UNIQUE(combo_id, edge_id)` prevents duplicate edge entries in the same combo
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from both FKs ensures cleanup
- Only the combo owner can INSERT/DELETE rows — enforced at the application level
- **Hidden edges stay:** If an edge's `is_hidden` becomes true via moderation, its annotations still appear on the combo page. The owner adding it implies trust.
- No `added_by` column needed since only the owner can add edges

#### `combo_subscriptions` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 39a, updated 39e)
Tracks which users are subscribed to which combos. Subscribing creates a persistent combo tab in the sidebar.

```sql
CREATE TABLE combo_subscriptions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  combo_id INTEGER REFERENCES combos(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  group_id INTEGER REFERENCES tab_groups(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, combo_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_combo_subscriptions_user ON combo_subscriptions(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_combo_subscriptions_combo ON combo_subscriptions(combo_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- `UNIQUE(user_id, combo_id)` prevents duplicate subscriptions
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from both `users` and `combos` ensures cleanup
- Subscribing creates a row in `sidebar_items` (item_type: `'combo'`); unsubscribing removes both
- Subscriber count displayed on combo listings and combo detail views
- `group_id` (Phase 39e) — nullable FK to `tab_groups`. Combo tabs can be placed in tab groups alongside graph tabs. `ON DELETE SET NULL` ungroups the tab when the group is deleted.
- Same pattern as `corpus_subscriptions`

#### `combo_annotation_votes` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 39a)
Votes on annotations within the context of a specific combo. These are separate from the corpus-level `annotation_votes` — a user can vote for an annotation in a combo without affecting its corpus vote count, and vice versa.

```sql
CREATE TABLE combo_annotation_votes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  combo_id INTEGER REFERENCES combos(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  annotation_id INTEGER REFERENCES document_annotations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, combo_id, annotation_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_combo_annotation_votes_combo_annotation ON combo_annotation_votes(combo_id, annotation_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- `UNIQUE(user_id, combo_id, annotation_id)` — one vote per user per annotation per combo
- Combo votes are independent from corpus-level `annotation_votes` — both counts displayed on combo page annotation cards
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from all three FKs ensures cleanup
- No auto-vote on annotation creation (unlike corpus annotations) — combo votes are always deliberate

#### `tunnel_links` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 43a)
Stores bidirectional tunnel connections between edges (concepts-in-context) across different graphs and attributes. Each row represents one direction of a link. Creating a tunnel always inserts two rows (A→B and B→A) in a single transaction.

```sql
CREATE TABLE tunnel_links (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  origin_edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  linked_edge_id INTEGER REFERENCES edges(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(origin_edge_id, linked_edge_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_tunnel_links_origin ON tunnel_links(origin_edge_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tunnel_links_linked ON tunnel_links(linked_edge_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- `UNIQUE(origin_edge_id, linked_edge_id)` prevents duplicate links in the same direction
- Creating a tunnel inserts TWO rows in a transaction: `(A, B)` and `(B, A)`. If either already exists, return 409.
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from edges ensures cleanup if an edge is removed
- `ON DELETE SET NULL` on `created_by` — link survives if creator deletes account
- Both rows share the same `created_by` and `created_at`
- Any logged-in user can create a tunnel link between any two edges
- Tunnel links are permanent (append-only) — cannot be deleted

#### `tunnel_votes` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 43a)
Endorsement votes on tunnel links. Votes are directional — voting for B in A's tunnel view does NOT affect A's vote count in B's tunnel view.

```sql
CREATE TABLE tunnel_votes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  tunnel_link_id INTEGER REFERENCES tunnel_links(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, tunnel_link_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_tunnel_votes_link ON tunnel_votes(tunnel_link_id);
```

**Key Points:**
- One vote per user per tunnel link (directional — the `tunnel_link_id` is for a specific A→B direction)
- Auto-vote on creation: when a user creates a tunnel, they auto-vote on BOTH directions
- Toggle on/off pattern, same as annotation votes and web link votes
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from both FKs ensures cleanup

#### `data_export_requests` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 52a)
Audit log for self-service data export requests, used to enforce a 2-export limit per user per rolling 12-month period.

```sql
CREATE TABLE data_export_requests (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  requested_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_data_export_requests_user_time ON data_export_requests(user_id, requested_at);
```

**Key Points:**
- One row inserted by `GET /api/users/me/export` AFTER successful data collection (so failed exports don't burn the user's quota — see Architecture Decision #274 for why this ordering matters).
- Rate limit check: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM data_export_requests WHERE user_id = $1 AND requested_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year'`. If >= 2, endpoint returns 429.
- The 2-per-12-months cap is **permitted but not required** by the Colorado Privacy Act — Orca enforces it for abuse prevention, not because the statute mandates it. See Architecture Decision #274 for the full rationale and where the legal grounding belongs in user-facing copy.
- `GET /api/users/me/export-status` (Phase 52b) reads the same count without inserting a row — used by the frontend to show the exports-used counter without consuming a quota.
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from `users` — when a user deletes their account, their export history is cleaned up. Acceptable because account deletion already breaks the link to personal data; export log retention is not legally required.
- This table is INDEPENDENT of the existing rate limiter infrastructure (`rate_limit_counters`, `userRateLimiter.js`, Phase 49). Different policy purpose: this is a legal/regulatory limit, not an abuse-prevention limit, and it spans 12 months (existing limiters are sub-hour windows).
- Append-only — never delete rows except via the cascade above.

---

#### `copyright_infringement_notices` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 53a)
Public intake table for DMCA §512(c)(3)(A) takedown notices submitted via the `/report-infringement` form. Permanent record — never deleted.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS copyright_infringement_notices (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  submitter_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  submitter_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Key Points:**
- Populated by `POST /api/legal/infringement` (no-auth public endpoint).
- The form copy on `/report-infringement` lists the §512(c)(3)(A) seven required elements (identification of copyrighted work, identification of allegedly infringing material, contact info, good-faith statement, accuracy-and-authority statement, signature) as guidance for what the submitter should include in the `body` text.
- `submitter_name` and `submitter_email` are captured as separate columns; everything else (the §512 substantive content) lives in the free-text `body`. This deliberate simplicity means the form imposes no specific structure on the body — the legal sufficiency of any given submission is evaluated manually by Miles when he reviews it.
- **No automated email** is sent on submission. Miles checks the table periodically: `SELECT * FROM copyright_infringement_notices ORDER BY created_at DESC;` and replies manually from `orcaconcepts@gmail.com`. See Architecture Decision #275.
- **Phase 53b (shipped):** Admin actions against notices create `legal_removals` rows referencing this notice via the `notice_reference` field (format: `copyright_infringement_notices.id=<id>`).
- Append-only by policy — submissions are legal records and should never be deleted.

#### `copyright_counter_notices` — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 53a)
Public intake table for DMCA §512(g)(3) counter-notifications submitted via the `/counter-notice` form. Permanent record — never deleted.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS copyright_counter_notices (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  submitter_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  submitter_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Key Points:**
- Populated by `POST /api/legal/counter-notice` (no-auth public endpoint — see Phase 53 "Open question" about whether this should require auth).
- The form copy on `/counter-notice` lists the §512(g)(3) required statements (identification of removed material, good-faith-mistake statement, consent-to-jurisdiction, signature) as guidance for what the submitter should include in the `body` text.
- Same shape as `copyright_infringement_notices` (deliberate symmetry). The `body` is free-text; legal sufficiency is evaluated manually.
- **No automated forwarding to the original complainant.** Miles manually emails the complainant (whose email is on the corresponding `copyright_infringement_notices` row, identified by Miles cross-referencing the body text since there is no FK link between counter-notices and the original infringement notices) with the counter-notice content. See Architecture Decision #275.
- The 10-business-day waiting period before content restoration (§512(g)(2)(C)) is tracked manually — Miles notes the counter-notice arrival date and watches for any court action notification before deciding to restore content.
- Append-only by policy — submissions are legal records and should never be deleted.

> **Future enhancement:** if volume grows, consider adding a `referenced_infringement_notice_id INTEGER REFERENCES copyright_infringement_notices(id)` column to formally link counter-notices to the original infringement notice they're responding to. For now, this linkage is captured in the body text and resolved manually.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication (`/api/auth`)

| Method | Endpoint | Auth Required | Description |
|--------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| POST | `/login` | No | Password login. Accepts `{ identifier, password }`. `identifier` is username or email (detected by `@`). Rate-limited: 10 req/IP/15 min. Returns JWT. (Phase 40b) |
| POST | `/send-code` | No | Send OTP via Twilio. Accepts `{ phoneNumber, intent }`. Rate-limited: 5 req/IP/15 min. `intent=register` checks phone uniqueness before sending. (Phase 32b, updated Phase 40b — `intent=login` removed) |
| POST | `/verify-register` | No | Verify OTP + create account. Accepts `{ phoneNumber, code, username, email, password, ageVerified, tosAccepted, tosVersion }`. Validates password with zxcvbn (score >= 2), email format, `ageVerified === true`, and `tosAccepted === true` (Phase 51a). Stores password_hash, email, sets `age_verified_at = NOW()`, `tos_accepted_at = NOW()`, `tos_version_accepted = <tosVersion>`. Returns JWT. (Phase 32b, updated Phase 36, Phase 40b, Phase 51a) |
| POST | `/forgot-password/send-code` | No | Send OTP for password reset. Accepts `{ phoneNumber }`. Looks up user via HMAC phone_lookup. Returns generic success message regardless of whether account exists (security best practice). Rate-limited: 5 req/IP/15 min. (Phase 40b) |

### Users (`/api/users`) — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 41a)

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/:id/profile` | Guest OK | Returns user's public profile: username, orcid_id (if set), created_at, corpus count, document count. (Phase 41a) |
| GET | `/search` | Required | Search users by username (ILIKE prefix match) or ORCID iD (exact match). Query: `?q=searchterm`. Returns max 10 results, excludes requesting user. (Phase 41d) |
| GET | `/me/export` | Required | Returns the requesting user's complete personal data + attributed contributions + votes/subscriptions as a downloadable JSON file. Top-level keys: `exported_at`, `export_version`, `account`, `contributions`, `votes_and_subscriptions`. NEVER includes `password_hash`, `phone_hash`, or `phone_lookup`. Rate-limited to 2 requests per user per rolling 12-month period (returns 429 with `{ error, exports_used, limit }` if exceeded). Audit row inserted into `data_export_requests` AFTER successful data collection. `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=orca-export-{username}-{ISO-date}.json`. (Phase 52a) |
| GET | `/me/export-status` | Required | Returns `{ exports_used, limit: 2, period: '12 months' }` for the requesting user — same count query as `/me/export` rate-limit check, but no audit insert. Used by the frontend to show "X of 2 exports used" without consuming quota. (Phase 52b) |
| PATCH | `/me` | Required | Update editable profile fields. Body: `{ email?: string }`. Validates and normalizes email (lowercase + trim) and writes to `users.email`. Returns `{ user: { id, username, email } }` on success, 400 on invalid format. Unknown body keys are ignored (extensible without breaking forward-compat). `username` and `orcid_id` are NOT editable here — username is locked post-registration (graph integrity), ORCID has its own connect/disconnect flow (Phase 41a). (Phase 52b) |

---

### Legal (`/api/legal`) — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 53a)

Public, no-auth endpoints for receiving copyright infringement notices and counter-notifications. Submissions are stored in dedicated tables for Miles to manually review and respond to via `orcaconcepts@gmail.com`. **No automated email is sent** — see Architecture Decision #275.

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/infringement` | No | Receives copyright infringement notices (DMCA §512(c)(3)(A) takedown intake). Accepts the form fields described on the `/report-infringement` page (claimant name, email, body content with the §512(c)(3)(A) seven required elements provided as a structured prompt to the submitter). Performs application-level validation of required fields. Inserts into `copyright_infringement_notices` table. Returns `{ success: true, id }` on success, 400 on missing required fields. Rate-limited via existing IP rate limiter (Phase 49) to deter abuse. (Phase 53a) |
| POST | `/counter-notice` | No | Receives DMCA counter-notifications (§512(g)(3)). Accepts the form fields described on the `/counter-notice` page (subscriber name, email, body content with the §512(g)(3) required statements provided as a structured prompt to the submitter). Inserts into `copyright_counter_notices` table. Returns `{ success: true, id }` on success, 400 on missing required fields. **Note:** Originally planned to be authenticated (so only the affected user could file), but built no-auth to keep the intake symmetric with the infringement form. Worth re-evaluating before public launch — see "Open question" in Phase 53 section. (Phase 53a) |

**Manual response workflow:** Miles checks both tables periodically with:
```sql
SELECT * FROM copyright_infringement_notices ORDER BY created_at DESC;
SELECT * FROM copyright_counter_notices ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
Then replies from `orcaconcepts@gmail.com` using the email address captured in the submission. No transactional email infrastructure needed.

### Concepts (`/api/concepts`)

All concept endpoints require authentication (JWT token in Authorization header).

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/root` | Get all root concepts (concepts with no parents) |
| GET | `/attributes` | Get all available attributes (action, tool, value, question) |
| GET | `/:id?path=...` | Get concept with children in specific context |
| GET | `/:id/parents?originPath=...` | Get all parent contexts for a concept (flip view). Returns `originEdgeId` and link vote counts in contextual mode. |
| GET | `/:id/votesets?path=...` | Get identical vote sets for children in a specific context. Returns color-assignable groups of users who saved the same children. |
| GET | `/search?q=...&parentId=...&path=...&attributeId=...` | Search concepts by name (text + trigram similarity). Optional `attributeId` filter returns only concepts with edges matching that attribute (Phase 43a). |
| GET | `/names/batch?ids=...` | Get concept names by comma-separated IDs |
| POST | `/root` | Create new root concept (requires attributeId) |
| POST | `/child` | Create child concept in specific context (requires attributeId) |
| POST | `/find-in-text` | Find all concept names appearing as whole words in provided text (Phase 7i). Guest-accessible. |
| GET | `/document-links/:documentId` | Get cached concept links for a finalized document. Recomputes if stale (Phase 7i-5). Guest-accessible. |
| POST | `/batch-children-for-diff` | Get children (with grandchildren for Jaccard) for multiple concepts in batch. Max 10 panes. Guest-accessible. (Phase 14a) |
| GET | `/:id/annotations` | Get all annotations across all edges where this concept is the child. Supports `?sort=votes\|subscribed\|newest`, `?edgeId=N` (single-context filter for children view), `?corpusIds=1,2,3`, `?tagId=N`. Returns flat array with context provenance, document info, vote counts, `subscribed_vote_count`. **Deduplicated across version chains** — when the same annotation (same edge + quote_text + creator) exists on multiple versions of a document, only the most recent version's annotation is returned. `subscribed` sort requires auth (ranks by votes from members of user's subscribed corpuses). Guest-accessible for other sorts. (Phase 27b, dedup Phase 31d, subscribed sort Phase 40) |

**Key Implementation Details:**

```javascript
// Get concept with children
GET /api/concepts/123?path=1,2

// Optional sort parameter:
GET /api/concepts/123?path=1,2&sort=new  // Sort children by newest first
// Default (no sort param or sort=saves): Sort by save count descending

// Returns:
{
  concept: { id, name, ... },
  path: [1, 2, 123],  // Includes current concept at end
  children: [
    { 
      id, 
      name, 
      edge_id, 
      vote_count,       // save count
      user_voted,       // Boolean: has current user saved this?
      child_count,      // Number of children this concept has
      attribute_id,     // Attribute ID for this edge
      attribute_name,   // Attribute name (e.g., "action", "tool", "value", "question")
      swap_count        // Number of distinct users with swap votes on this edge
    }
  ],
  currentEdgeVoteCount,  // Save count on edge connecting this concept to its parent (null for root concepts navigated to without a path, integer otherwise — including root concepts via root edge)
  currentAttribute       // { id, name } — attribute of this concept in current path context (null if no path context)
}

// Create child concept
POST /api/concepts/child
Body: { 
  name: "Exercise",      // Max 255 characters
  parentId: 2,
  path: "1",             // Comma-separated path (excludes parent)
  attributeId: 1         // Required — ID of attribute (action, tool, value, or question)
}

// The backend will:
// 1. Validate concept name is ≤ 255 characters
// 2. Check if concept exists (by name, case-insensitive)
// 3. If exists, use existing concept ID
// 4. If not, create new concept
// 5. Create edge with graph_path = [1, 2]
// 6. Check for cycles (concept can't be in its own ancestor path)
```

## Vote Type Terminology

Orca uses three vote types, each with a short name reflecting its action:

| Short Name | Full Name | Purpose | Scope | Destination Required |
|------------|-----------|---------|-------|---------------------|
| **Save** | Save Vote | Endorse a concept in context; saves full path to Saved Page | Full path (max 1 per user per edge) | No |
| ~~**Move**~~ | ~~Move Vote (formerly "Side Vote")~~ | ~~Assert concept belongs in a different context~~ | ~~Single edge~~ | ~~Yes — user specifies destination context~~ |
| **Swap** | Swap Vote (formerly "Replace-With Vote") | Assert concept should be replaced by a sibling | Single edge | Yes — user specifies sibling |
| **Link** | Link Vote (formerly "Similarity Vote") | Assert a parent context is helpful relative to origin context (Flip View only) | Contextual Flip View only | No — applied to existing parent context |
| **Tunnel** | Tunnel Vote | Assert a cross-graph/cross-attribute edge link is meaningful | Tunnel View only | No — applied to existing tunnel link |

**Naming convention:** UI buttons and labels use the short names (Save, Swap, Link). Technical documentation and database tables may still reference the original table names (`votes`, `replace_votes`, `similarity_votes`) for continuity.

Deleted uploader case returns `uploadedByUsername: null` via LEFT JOIN. Ordered by `created_at DESC`. Uses existing `idx_citation_links_cited_annotation` index. (Phase 50a) |

**Note:** Annotations also have a `cited_by_count` field (or `citedByCount` in camelCase endpoints) returned alongside the main annotation object on six endpoints: `getDocumentAnnotations`, `getAllDocumentAnnotations`, `getAnnotationsForEdge`, `getConceptAnnotations`, `getAnnotationsForConceptOnDocument`, and `getComboAnnotations`.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/legal-removal` | Perform a legal removal. Body: `{ target_type, target_id, removal_reason, notice_reference, internal_notes }`. Hard-deletes documents/annotations/comments; hides+legal_hold for concepts/edges/web_links. Writes `legal_removals` audit row. Auto-inserts `dmca_strikes` row for DMCA removals with non-null affected user. Returns `{ success, legal_removal_id, affected_user_email, affected_username }`. (Phase 53b) |

| POST | `/legal/strikes/:id/clear` | Dismiss a DMCA strike. Body: `{ reason }`. Sets `cleared_at = NOW()` and `cleared_reason`. (Phase 53c) |

### Info Pages (`/api/pages`) — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase 30g)

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/:slug/comments` | Guest OK (optionalAuth) | Get comments for an info page. Returns tree structure: top-level comments with nested `replies` array. Sorted by vote count desc, then chronologically. Valid slugs: `using-orca` (Constitution and Donate removed in Phase 56a). If authenticated, includes `user_voted` boolean per comment. |
| POST | `/:slug/comments` | Required | Add a comment to an info page. Body: `{ body, parentCommentId? }`. Max 2000 chars. Cannot reply to a reply (1-level nesting enforced). Auto-votes for the creator (starts at vote_count = 1). |

## Development Workflow

### Starting the Application

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run migrate  # First time only
npm run dev      # Starts on port 5000
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev      # Starts on port 3000
```

**Access:** Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`

### Stopping the Application

Press `Ctrl+C` in both terminal windows.

## Known Technical Issues & Workarounds

### 1. bcrypt on ARM64 Windows
**Issue:** bcrypt package doesn't compile on ARM64 Windows (Surface devices, etc.)

**Solution:** Using bcryptjs instead
- Edit `backend/package.json`: Change `"bcrypt"` to `"bcryptjs"`
- Edit `backend/src/controllers/authController.js`: Change import to `require('bcryptjs')`

### 2. Node Modules Cleanup Errors
**Issue:** Sometimes npm install shows EPERM errors during cleanup

**Solution:** These are warnings, not errors. Installation usually completes successfully. If it fails:
```bash
rmdir /s /q node_modules
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

### 3. Path Array Includes Current Concept
**Issue:** The `path` array returned from the API includes the current concept at the end

**Example:**
- Viewing concept ID 3
- API returns: `path: [1, 2, 3]`
- For breadcrumbs, we need to exclude the last element: `path.slice(0, -1)`

**Impact:** Breadcrumb click handling needs to account for this (subtract 1 from clicked index)

### 4. Root Concepts Created Before Root Edge Feature
**Issue:** Root concepts created before the root edge feature was added (Feb 21, 2026) do not have root edges, so voting won't work on them.

**Solution:** Run this SQL to backfill root edges for existing root concepts:
```sql
INSERT INTO edges (parent_id, child_id, graph_path, created_by)
SELECT NULL, c.id, '{}', c.created_by
FROM concepts c
WHERE c.id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT child_id FROM edges);
```
New root concepts created after this feature automatically get root edges.

### 5. pg_trgm Extension Required for Search — ✅ RESOLVED
**Previously:** The Combined Add/Search field uses PostgreSQL's `pg_trgm` extension for fuzzy matching. If the extension was not enabled (and the supporting indexes not created), search queries failed with a database error, and operators had to run `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm` plus the concept-name indexes manually.

**Resolution:** `backend/src/config/migrate.js` now runs `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm` at the top of the migration, and creates `idx_concepts_name_trgm` and `idx_concepts_name_lower` immediately after the `concepts` table. All three statements use `IF NOT EXISTS` so the migration is idempotent. `npm run migrate` against a fresh database now sets up everything search needs, with no manual SQL required. The Railway Postgres role must have permission to create extensions (standard on Railway Postgres).

### 6. Vite Restart Required After Adding New Files
**Issue:** When a brand new `.jsx` file is added to the project (e.g., `Saved.jsx`), Vite's hot module replacement may not pick it up. Navigating to the new route redirects to `/` instead.

**Solution:** Stop the frontend dev server (`Ctrl+C`) and restart it:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
This only needs to be done once per new file. Edits to existing files are picked up automatically.

### 7. Edge Browser Mini Menu Blocks Annotation Text Selection
**Issue:** Microsoft Edge's built-in "mini menu" (Ask Copilot, Copy, Search) pops up whenever text is selected, overlapping Orca's annotation toolbar. This makes it difficult to click the "Annotate" button after selecting text. Chrome does not have this issue.

**Solution (per-user browser setting — not fixable in code):**
- In Edge, go to **Settings → Appearance → Context Menus**
- Toggle OFF **"Show mini menu when selecting text"**
- Alternatively, add just the Orca site to the "Disallowed sites" list to disable only for Orca: Settings → Appearance → Context Menus → "Mini menu is disabled for these sites" → Add → enter the Orca URL

**Note:** This affects all Edge users. Consider mentioning this in onboarding documentation or a help tooltip if Edge users report annotation difficulty.

### 8. Destructive Migrations in migrate.js Corrupted Edge Attributes (April 2026)
**Issue:** All 216 edges in the database had their `attribute_id` silently overwritten to "value" — concepts that were created as `[question]`, `[action]`, or `[tool]` all became `[value]`. The corruption was irrecoverable because the original attribute assignments were overwritten in place.

**Root cause:** Two migrations in `migrate.js` ran destructively on every `npm run migrate` call:
- **Phase 20a** normalized all edges in each graph to the most common attribute, deleting edges that would collide
- **Phase 25e** force-converted every edge to the "value" attribute (`UPDATE edges SET attribute_id = $1 WHERE attribute_id != $1`)

These were one-time data transformations that should have been removed after their initial run, but they remained in `migrate.js` as live code. Because Orca's migration system re-runs all migrations on every call (no tracking of which migrations have been applied), they silently re-executed every time the backend was restarted with `npm run migrate`, destroying any attribute diversity created since the last migration run.

**Fix:** Both migrations were removed from `migrate.js` in April 2026. Single-attribute-per-graph consistency is enforced at write time by `createChildConcept`, which looks up the root edge's attribute via `graph_path[0]` — no migration needed.

**Prevention rule — CRITICAL for all future migrate.js changes:**
> **Never add an UPDATE or DELETE statement to migrate.js that modifies existing user data.** Orca's migration system has no "already applied" tracking — every statement in `migrate.js` runs on every call. Migrations must be **idempotent and non-destructive**:
> - `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` — safe (no-op if table exists)
> - `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` wrapped in `IF NOT EXISTS` — safe
> - `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` for seed data — safe
> - `UPDATE edges SET attribute_id = ...` — **DANGEROUS, will re-run and corrupt data**
> - `DELETE FROM` — **DANGEROUS, will re-run and destroy data**
>
> If a one-time data transformation is needed, run it as a standalone script (not in migrate.js), verify the result, and do not leave the script wired into the migration pipeline.

## Current Feature Status & Architecture Notes

**Note:** Detailed phase implementation narratives (Phases 1–36) and git commit logs have been moved to `ORCA_HISTORY.md` to keep this file focused on active reference material. The numbered architecture notes below and the phase summary list encode the rules and patterns that Claude Code needs for implementation work.

---

47. **External Links Page Has Two Sections Built in Different Phases:** The External Links page for a concept has two distinct sections: "Web Links" (user-submitted URLs with upvote voting, built in Phase 6) and "Document Annotations" (documents grouped by corpus showing where this concept is annotated, built in Phase 7d). Phase 6 ships with web links only; the corpus/document section is added once the corpus infrastructure exists.
48. **Corpus Groups Are Atomic in External Links Sorting:** When viewing document annotations on the External Links page, documents are grouped by corpus and corpus groups never break apart during sorting. A corpus group's position is determined by its top-ranked document (for vote/recency sorts) or by subscriber count. Lower-ranked documents within a corpus stay with their group even if individually they'd rank below docs in other corpuses.
49. **Web Link Voting Is Simple Upvotes:** Web links use a simple one-vote-per-user upvote system (`concept_link_votes` table), not the four-type vote system (save/move/swap/link) used for edges. This keeps the web link interaction lightweight.
37. **Tiered View Is Opt-In:** When filtering by multiple vote set swatches, the default is a flat sorted list (match count descending, then saves). Tiered view (ranked sections with headers) is behind a ☰ toggle that only appears when 2+ swatches are selected. This keeps the simple case simple while offering deeper analysis on demand. *(Note: Super-group swatches were retired in Phase 28b — only individual vote set swatches remain.)*
38. **AppShell Architecture:** All authenticated routes go through a single `AppShell.jsx` component that provides the header (title, Graph Votes button, Corpuses button, username, logout, logout everywhere) and the unified tab bar. The tab bar contains corpus tabs and graph tabs only — saved tabs were moved to a standalone Saved Page overlay in Phase 7c. Root.jsx, Concept.jsx, and CorpusTabContent.jsx render inside AppShell's content area based on the active tab. `App.jsx` only handles the AppShell catch-all — login/register routes were replaced by an inline `LoginModal.jsx` (Phase 28f, rewritten Phase 32c for phone OTP) with Log In / Sign Up tabs, dismissable via backdrop click or Escape. The `/login` and `/register` routes now redirect to `/`.
39. **Graph Tabs Are Persistent:** Graph tabs are stored in the `graph_tabs` database table and survive page refresh, logout, and login. Each tab stores `tab_type`, `concept_id`, `path`, `view_mode`, and `label`. When the user navigates within a graph tab, the backend is updated via `POST /votes/graph-tabs/update`. This differs from Saved tabs which are purely organizational — graph tabs track live navigation state.
40. **Saved Tab Deletion Safety:** Saved tabs cannot be deleted via a simple ✕ button (too easy to accidentally unsave all concepts). Instead, deletion requires right-click → context menu → "Remove tab and unsave concepts" with a confirmation dialog. This mirrors the philosophy that destructive actions on saved data should require deliberate intent.
41. **Concept.jsx Dual Mode:** Concept.jsx operates in two modes: "tab mode" (inside AppShell, receives `graphTabId` and `onNavigate` props, navigation happens via state + API calls) and "standalone mode" (URL-routed, used when opening a concept in a new browser window). Tab mode is detected by the presence of `graphTabId`. In tab mode, Concept.jsx maintains a `navHistory` array for in-tab back button support.
42. **Sidebar Layout (Phase 12b, replaces horizontal tab bar, updated Phase 19b/28a):** The app uses a vertical sidebar on the left (220px, collapsible) instead of a horizontal tab bar. After Phase 19b, the three labeled sections were merged into a single unlabeled unified list. "Graph Votes" and "Browse" buttons are in the sidebar top section (not the header). Active items have a left border highlight. The sidebar collapses to a 24px bar with a » expand button. Graph tabs have ✕ close buttons; corpus tabs do not (unsubscribe to remove). Right-click any item for context menu. All emoji icons (📚) were removed from sidebar items in Phase 28a.
50. **Sort by Annotation Count (Future):** A third sort option for child concepts (alongside sort-by-saves and sort-by-new) that orders children by how many distinct corpus documents contain them as annotations. Depends on Phase 7 infrastructure. Uses `document_annotations` table to count distinct `document_id` per child edge.
51. **Concept Diffing Uses Grandchild Jaccard Similarity:** The Diff modal compares child concepts across panes by computing Jaccard similarity on their own children (the parent concept's grandchildren). Two children from different panes are "similar" (Group 2) if their child sets overlap by ≥ 50%. Children with the same name + attribute across panes are "shared" (Group 3). Children that are neither shared nor similar are "unique" (Group 1). This reuses the same Jaccard formula as Flip View similarity percentage.
52. **Diff Modal Is Independent of Graph Navigation:** The Diff modal is a dedicated overlay opened via right-click on any concept. It does not affect the user's graph tabs or navigation state. Concepts are selected in context (specific path) within the modal. No new database tables are required — the modal reads from existing `edges`, `concepts`, and `attributes` tables with on-the-fly similarity computation.
53. **Child Rankings — 💤 RETIRED (Phase 28b):** The ranking UI was removed. Users could assign numeric rankings to children within their own vote set, with aggregated display for other sets. The `child_rankings` table, backend endpoints, and ranking cleanup logic remain but are no longer exercised by the frontend. Rankings were: own set only (backend validated), aggregated read-only for other sets, 1-to-N selector, stored with `vote_set_key` for staleness detection.
54. **Guest Access Uses `optionalAuth` Middleware:** Read-only GET endpoints for concepts use `optionalAuth` (extracts user if token present, proceeds with `req.user = null` otherwise). Write endpoints (POST for creating concepts, all vote routes) remain behind `authenticateToken`. SQL queries pass `-1` as user ID for guests, ensuring `BOOL_OR(v.user_id = $1)` always returns false. This avoids separate query branches for guests vs logged-in users.
55. **Guest Graph Tabs Are Ephemeral:** Guest users get local-only graph tabs that exist only in React state. Tab IDs use string format (`guest-1`, `guest-2`, etc.) to avoid collisions with DB integer IDs. No API calls for tab CRUD in guest mode. Tabs are lost on page refresh — this is by design per the status doc spec.
56. **Search Surfacing Saved Tabs:** The search endpoint cross-references results against the logged-in user's saved edges via a join through `votes` → `vote_tab_links` → `saved_tabs` → `edges`. Returns a `savedTabs` array per result with `{tabId, tabName}`. Results are sorted so saved-tab matches appear first. Guests get empty `savedTabs` arrays (the query is skipped when `req.user` is null). Corpus annotation surfacing will reuse this same pattern when Phase 7 infrastructure exists.
57. **FlipView Navigation Requires Callback in Tab Mode:** FlipView accepts an `onParentClick` callback prop from Concept.jsx. In tab mode, clicking an alt parent card calls this callback which runs `navigateInTab()` for proper in-tab navigation with nav history. In standalone mode (no callback), falls back to URL-based `navigate()`. This pattern matches how SearchField already handles tab-mode navigation.
58. **Web Links Are Context-Specific (Edge-Tied):** External web links attach to edges, not concepts globally. The same concept in different parent contexts can have entirely different sets of web links. This is consistent with how all other data in Orca (saves, swaps, attributes) is context-specific. The `concept_links` table has a foreign key to `edges(id)` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
59. **Web Link Voting Is Simple Upvotes:** Web links use a one-vote-per-user upvote system (`concept_link_votes` table), not the four-type vote system (save/move/swap/link) used for edges. This keeps the web link interaction lightweight. Auto-upvote on creation ensures the adder's vote is counted. Only the adder can remove a link.
60. **Cross-Context Links View Is Read-Only for Non-Current Contexts:** The FlipLinksView (🔗 All Links in Flip View) shows all web links across all parent contexts, but upvoting is only interactive for links in the current context. Other contexts are read-only with a "view only" hint. This prevents users from voting on links they may not have full context for.
61. **External Links Page Access Depends on parentEdgeId — ⚠️ Moot (Phase 27a):** The External Links page was retired in Phase 27a and replaced by the ConceptAnnotationPanel's Web Links tab. The old 🔗 Links button was removed. Web links are now accessible via the right-column annotation panel.
62. **Shareable Concept Links Use Standalone Mode URLs:** The Share button generates URLs in the format `/concept/:id?path=...` which works in standalone mode (direct URL navigation, outside the tab system). When someone opens a shared link, they get a fresh AppShell with the concept loaded in a new graph tab. The path parameter uses `effectivePath.slice(0, -1)` to exclude the current concept ID (matching how the `path` query param works in the routing system).
63. **View Modes in Concept.jsx (Updated Phase 43b):** Concept.jsx now supports three view modes: `'children'` (default), `'flip'` (Flip View), and `'tunnel'` (Tunnel View). All modes are stored in tab navigation state, support nav history (back button), and persist in the `graph_tabs` database table via `view_mode` column. The URL also supports `?view=flip` and `?view=tunnel` for standalone mode. The Tunnel button is only accessible from children view (hidden in flip view). When in tunnel view, the annotation panel (right column) is hidden — tunnel view uses full width for attribute columns. *(Phase 27a retired `'links'` and `'fliplinks'` view modes — web links and cross-context annotations are now served by ConceptAnnotationPanel in the right column. Migration updates stale graph_tabs rows.)*
64. **Corpus View Is an AppShell Overlay (Phase 7a):** The corpus browsing UI (list → detail → document) renders as an overlay in AppShell's content area, replacing tab content while active. Tab content is preserved underneath (not unmounted) via a `corpusView` state object: `null` (not showing), `{ view: 'list' }`, `{ view: 'detail', corpusId }`, or `{ view: 'document', documentId, corpusId }`. The Corpuses button in the sidebar toggles this overlay. This is a temporary architecture for Phase 7a — in Phase 7c, corpus tabs will become persistent tab-bar elements alongside graph tabs, and the overlay pattern will be retired.
65. **Corpus Ownership Enforced Server-Side:** All ownership checks (update, delete, add/remove documents) are validated on the backend by comparing `req.user.userId` against `corpuses.created_by`. The frontend shows owner controls to all logged-in users for simplicity, relying on the backend to reject unauthorized actions. This avoids passing user IDs through component props.
66. **Document Orphan Cleanup Is Transactional:** When removing a document from a corpus or deleting a corpus, the backend uses a database transaction to (1) remove the corpus-document link, (2) check if the document is in zero corpuses, and (3) delete the orphaned document if so. This prevents race conditions where a document could be left in limbo.
67. **Unique Corpus Names (Case-Insensitive):** No two corpuses can share the same name (compared case-insensitively). Enforced at the application level on both create and rename. Returns 409 Conflict if a duplicate name is found. Corpus and document namespaces are independent — a corpus and document can share the same name.
68. **Unique Document Titles (Case-Insensitive):** No two documents can share the same title (compared case-insensitively). Enforced at the application level on upload. Returns 409 Conflict if a duplicate title is found.
69. **Duplicate Detection Uses Truncated Prefix:** The duplicate detection endpoint compares the first 5,000 characters of document bodies using `pg_trgm` `similarity()`. This balances accuracy (5,000 chars captures the distinctive content) with performance (full-body trigram comparison on very long documents is expensive). The threshold is 0.3 (30% similarity). If the check fails for any reason, the upload proceeds normally — it's a best-effort confirmation step, not a hard gate.
70. **Corpus Subscriptions Create Persistent Tabs:** Subscribing to a corpus via `POST /api/corpuses/subscribe` creates a persistent corpus tab in the main tab bar. Unsubscribing via `POST /api/corpuses/unsubscribe` removes it. The `corpus_subscriptions` table is the source of truth — corpus tabs are loaded from `GET /api/corpuses/subscriptions` on mount. Corpus tabs are not closeable with ✕ (unlike graph tabs) — unsubscribing is the way to remove them.
71. **Graph Votes Page Is a Standalone Overlay (Phase 7c, renamed Phase 28c):** Saved tabs were removed from the main tab bar and moved into a standalone page (now called "Graph Votes") accessible via a "Graph Votes" button in the sidebar. The page renders as a full-page overlay containing its own internal tab bar with corpus-based tabs (dynamically generated from annotation membership). Clicking a concept opens it in a graph tab and closes the overlay. The old `saved_tabs`/`vote_tab_links` tables are functionally retired — tabs are now auto-generated from corpus annotation membership.
72. **Main Tab Bar Contains Only Corpus + Graph Tabs (Phase 7c):** After the Saved Page Overhaul, the main tab bar contains only two tab types: corpus tabs (subscription-based, persistent) and graph tabs (user-created, persistent, closeable). Tab groups can contain graph tabs. The active tab type is either `'corpus'` or `'graph'` — `'saved'` is no longer a valid active tab type in the main tab bar.
73. **Saved Tabs Still Needed for Vote Action:** Even though saved tabs are no longer in the main tab bar, the `savedTabs` state is still loaded in AppShell and passed to Root.jsx/Concept.jsx as a prop. This is because the ▲ vote button's tab picker needs to know which saved tabs exist. The vote action targets a specific saved tab via the `tabId` parameter on `POST /api/votes/add`.
74. **Annotations Are Three-Way Links (Corpus × Document × Edge):** Each annotation links a corpus, a document, and an edge (concept-in-context). The corpus scoping means the same document in different corpuses has entirely separate annotation sets. Character offsets (start_position, end_position) are stored against the immutable document body, which guarantees offsets remain valid over time.
75. **Annotation Permission Follows Combined Model:** Every corpus has a public layer (any logged-in user can annotate) and an editorial layer (only allowed users can annotate; visible to all). Allowed users can remove annotations with a changelog. The `layer` column on `document_annotations` tracks which layer an annotation belongs to (`'public'` or `'editorial'`). This replaces the original binary annotation_mode.
76. **Root Edges Not Returned by Parents Endpoint:** The `getConceptParents` backend endpoint uses `JOIN concepts c ON e.parent_id = c.id`, which excludes root edges (where `parent_id IS NULL`). The AnnotationPanel works around this by separately checking `getRootConcepts` to find root edges for the selected concept. This ensures root-level concepts can be used as annotations.
77. **Full Path Resolution Uses `getConceptNames` Batch Endpoint:** Both AnnotationPanel (context picker) and CorpusTabContent (annotation detail sidebar) resolve `graph_path` integer arrays to human-readable names by calling the `getConceptNames` batch endpoint. The response format is `{ concepts: [{ id, name }, ...] }` which must be converted to an `{ id: name }` lookup map before use.
78. **Avoid Naming React State `document`:** The browser global `document` is needed for DOM APIs like `createRange()`. Naming a React state variable `document` shadows it, causing runtime errors. Use `window.document` to explicitly reach the browser API, or rename the state variable.
79. **All Document Viewing Goes Through CorpusTabContent (Phase 7d-4):** The Phase 7a `DocumentView` component (used in the Corpuses overlay) has no annotation support. After Phase 7d, clicking a document in `CorpusDetailView` subscribes to the corpus and redirects to the corpus tab with `pendingDocumentId`, ensuring annotations are always visible. The `DocumentView` overlay is retained in AppShell rendering (for backward compatibility) but is no longer the primary document viewing path from the Corpuses overlay.
80. **Pending Document Pattern for Cross-Component Navigation:** When one component needs to tell another component (that may not be mounted yet) to open a specific document, AppShell stores a `pendingCorpusDocumentId` in state. The target component (`CorpusTabContent`) watches for this prop and auto-opens the document once its corpus data finishes loading. The pending state is cleared via a callback after consumption. This pattern avoids complex ref threading or event buses.
81. **External Links Page — ⚠️ RETIRED (Phase 27a):** The External Links page (`WebLinksView.jsx`) with separate "Web Links" and "Document Annotations" sections was deleted in Phase 27a. Its functionality is now served by ConceptAnnotationPanel in the right column of the concept page, with Annotations and Web Links tabs.
82. **Combined Public/Private Replaces Binary Toggle:** The original `annotation_mode` column ('public'/'private') on `corpuses` is retired in Phase 7g. Every corpus always has both a public layer (any logged-in user) and a private layer (allowed users only). Annotations get a `layer` column ('public'/'private') to track which layer they belong to. Allowed users can filter to see only private-layer content. This is a fundamental design change — there is no longer a binary choice at corpus creation time.
83. **Allowed User Annotation Removal with Changelog:** Allowed users can remove annotations from documents in their corpus, but every removal is logged in an `annotation_removal_log` table (who removed it, when, what the annotation was). This provides accountability within the allowed-user group. The changelog is visible to all allowed users of the corpus.
84. **Document Versioning Is Within-Corpus:** New document versions are auto-added to the same corpus as the source. Version numbers are tracked via `version_number` column (auto-incremented per lineage) and `source_document_id` (self-referencing FK forming a version chain). This keeps version numbering separate from the document title to avoid naming collisions. Only the document's original uploader can create versions (Phase 25c tightens from previously allowing any allowed user).
85. **Draft State Removed (Phase 21a):** The `is_draft` column and all draft/finalize logic were removed in Phase 21a. Documents are now always editable by their original uploader. Annotation offsets are adjusted via `diff-match-patch` on each edit. The previous model (drafts start editable, finalized = immutable) was replaced by the always-editable model.
86. **Annotation Offset Adjustment on Document Edit (Phase 21a):** When a document is edited, the backend computes a diff using `diff-match-patch` and adjusts all annotation offsets accordingly. Text inserted before an annotation shifts offsets forward; text deleted shifts backward; text inserted within an annotated region expands the end offset; annotated text partially or fully deleted causes annotation removal. This replaces the previous model where only draft versions could trigger annotation removal.
87. **Live Concept Linking in Documents:** As users type or paste text into a document (during draft editing or initial upload), text matching existing concept names is automatically underlined. Clicking an underline opens a decontextualized Flip View for that concept in a new graph tab. On finalized documents, concept links are pre-computed and cached. Links are invalidated when new matching concepts are created.
88. **Orphan Rescue for Allowed Users' Documents (Phase 9b):** When a corpus is deleted or a document is removed, if the document would become orphaned AND was uploaded by an allowed user (not the corpus owner), the document is left in the database with zero corpus memberships instead of being auto-deleted. The author sees a rescue modal on next app load, where they can add the doc to another corpus, create a new corpus, or dismiss (permanently delete). No expiry timer or background job — orphans persist indefinitely. Only `uploaded_by` is checked (not `added_by`) since the goal is protecting actual authors' work.
89. **Phase 9 Change Log Dropped:** The Phase 9c change log feature was removed from the roadmap. Users are expected to explore documents and graphs using color sets and annotation color set votes to understand how concepts are used in specific communities. The allowed-user annotation removal changelog (Phase 7g) provides accountability for curation decisions within the private layer.
90. **Decontextualized Document View — ❌ REMOVED (Phase 28):** The decontextualized document view (parallel to decontextualized Flip View) was removed. The original design allowed cross-corpus annotation browsing via a standalone overlay, but the ConceptAnnotationPanel (Phase 27) now serves this discovery purpose more effectively. Guest users who click annotation cards in the ConceptAnnotationPanel see a login modal prompting them to log in for full document access.
91. **Annotation Duplicate Merging in Decontextualized View — ⚠️ Moot (Phase 28):** This feature was part of the decontextualized document view which has been removed. The backend `getAllDocumentAnnotations` endpoint still contains this merging logic but is no longer called from the frontend.
92. **Add Existing Document Flow:** Corpus owners can add an existing document (already uploaded into another corpus) to their corpus via a title search. The backend endpoint (`GET /documents/search`) uses ILIKE for case-insensitive partial matching and excludes documents already in the target corpus. This is the frontend for the `POST /:id/documents/add` endpoint that existed since Phase 7a but had no UI.
93. **Annotation Voting Uses Simple Endorsements:** Annotation votes are simple endorsements (one vote per user per annotation) via the `annotation_votes` table, similar to web link upvotes (`concept_link_votes`). This is separate from edge save votes. Vote count and user_voted status are returned inline with annotation data by the `getDocumentAnnotations` query.
94. **Color Set Voting Is Per-Annotation, Not Per-Edge:** Users pick a preferred children vote set (color set) for each individual annotation, not globally for an edge. This is intentional — different annotations of the same concept in different documents/corpuses may warrant different color set preferences depending on the document's context.
95. **Color Set Selection Is Deferred, Not On-Creation:** When creating an annotation, no color set is selected. The annotator (or any user) picks a color set later from the annotation detail sidebar. This keeps annotation creation fast and avoids forcing users to understand vote sets before they can annotate. Users can navigate to the concept in a graph tab to browse color sets, then come back and pick one.
96. **Corpus Tabs Are Groupable (Phase 7f):** Corpus tabs can now be placed in tab groups alongside graph tabs. The `group_id` column on `corpus_subscriptions` tracks group membership. Backend `addTabToGroup`/`removeTabFromGroup`/`deleteTabGroup` handle `tabType === 'corpus'`. This allows corpus tabs and related graph tabs to be visually grouped together in the tab bar.
97. **Auto-Group on Navigate-to-Concept from Annotation:** Clicking "Navigate to concept →" in the annotation detail sidebar creates a new graph tab and automatically groups it with the source corpus tab. If the corpus tab is already in a group, the graph tab joins that group. If not, a new group is created (named after the corpus) containing both tabs. This keeps related corpus + graph exploration visually adjacent.
98. **Corpus Tabs Rendered with Display:None (Not Conditional Mount):** All corpus tabs are mounted simultaneously and hidden with `display: none` when inactive, matching the pattern used for graph tabs. This preserves open document state, scroll position, and selected annotations when switching between tabs. Previously, only the active corpus tab was mounted, causing state loss on tab switch.
99. **Annotation Scoping Gotcha:** Annotations are scoped to their corpus — the same document in different corpuses has separate annotation sets. When testing annotations, verify you're viewing the document through the correct corpus tab. An annotation created in Corpus A won't appear when viewing the document through Corpus B.
100. **Frontend User Object Uses `id`, Not `userId`:** The auth context's `user` object comes from the backend's `/auth/login` and `/auth/me` responses, which return database rows with `id` as the primary key. The JWT payload internally uses `userId`, but this is only relevant on the backend (`req.user.userId`). On the frontend, always use `user.id`. This caused a subtle bug where `isOwner` comparisons using `user?.userId` returned `undefined`.
101. **Invite Token Flow:** Corpus owners generate invite tokens (random 48-char URL-safe strings). The invite URL is `{origin}/invite/{token}`. The frontend `AcceptInvite.jsx` component handles `/invite/:token` — if logged in, it calls `POST /corpuses/invite/accept`; if not logged in, it redirects to `/login?returnTo=/invite/{token}`. Tokens can optionally have expiry dates and max-use limits.
102. **Layer Filter Reloads Annotations:** Changing the layer filter (All/Public/Private) in CorpusTabContent triggers a `useEffect` that calls `loadAnnotations` with the new filter value. The backend's `getDocumentAnnotations` accepts `?layer=public|private` to filter, or returns all visible annotations (public + private for allowed users, public-only for others) when no filter is specified.
103. **Editorial Annotations Use Green-Tinted Highlights:** To visually distinguish editorial-layer annotations from public ones, editorial annotations use a green-tinted background (`rgba(90, 122, 90, 0.15)`) with a green underline, compared to the default gold/yellow for public annotations. An "editorial" badge also appears in the annotation detail sidebar.
104. **Annotation Creation Layer Follows Active Filter:** When the layer filter is set to "Editorial" and the user is an allowed user, new annotations are created in the editorial layer. The annotate button shows "Annotate (editorial)" and the AnnotationPanel header confirms "(editorial layer)". When the filter is "All" or "Public", annotations default to the public layer.
105. **`annotation_mode` Column Functionally Retired:** The `corpuses.annotation_mode` column ('public'/'private') still exists in the database but is no longer used for permission checks as of Phase 7g. All permission logic now uses the `layer` column on `document_annotations` plus `corpus_allowed_users` membership. The column was not dropped to avoid a breaking migration, but it should not be referenced in new code.
106. **Allowed User Deletion Logging:** When an allowed user (or corpus owner) removes an annotation they didn't create, the removal is logged in `annotation_removal_log`. Creators removing their own annotations are NOT logged. The log captures the annotation's position, layer, original creator, and remover, using `ON DELETE SET NULL` FKs so entries survive entity deletion.
107. **Version History Uses Recursive CTE:** The `getVersionHistory` endpoint finds all versions in a document's lineage using two recursive CTEs: first walking UP from the requested document to find the root (the original v1 with no `source_document_id`), then walking DOWN from the root to find all descendants. This handles arbitrarily deep version chains without knowing the full lineage structure ahead of time.
108. **Version History Is Universally Accessible:** All users (owners, allowed users, regular users, and guests) can view a document's version history and navigate between versions. The "Version history" button appears on every document view unconditionally. Creating new versions is restricted to the document's original uploader (Phase 25c tightens from previously allowing owner/allowed users), but reading version history is read-only public information.
109. **Annotation Auto-Adjustment on Document Edit (Phase 21a):** When a document's body text is edited via `POST /corpuses/documents/:id/edit`, the backend uses `diff-match-patch` to compute positional diffs and adjust all annotation offsets. Annotations whose anchored text was removed or changed beyond recognition are deleted. Each removal is logged in `annotation_removal_log` for accountability. This replaces the old `updateDraft` approach that simply checked if text at offsets had changed.
110. **Version Numbers Are Lineage-Global:** When creating a new version, the backend finds the maximum `version_number` across all documents in the lineage (using both `id` and `source_document_id` relationships) and increments it. This ensures version numbers are unique and monotonically increasing across the entire chain, even if versions are created from different branch points.
111. **New Versions Propagate to All Source Corpuses:** When creating a new document version, the new version is automatically added to every corpus the source document belongs to (not just the requesting corpus). This ensures version lineages stay consistent across corpuses. The requesting corpus is also included as a safety net for cross-corpus version history navigation.
112. **Concept Links Are Non-Overlapping, Annotation-Subordinate:** In document rendering, annotations always take priority over concept link underlines. The `buildAnnotatedBody` function first lays out annotation segments, then weaves concept link underlines into the plain-text gaps between annotations. If a concept name falls within an annotated region, it does not get a separate underline — the annotation highlight takes precedence.
113. **Concept Link Matching Uses Whole-Word Regex:** The `findConceptsInText` backend endpoint uses `\b` word boundaries for case-insensitive matching against all concept names. Names are processed longest-first so longer matches take priority. Non-overlapping filtering (earlier/longer match wins) prevents double-linking. Special regex characters in concept names are escaped.
114. **`handleOpenConceptTab` Supports Optional `viewMode` Parameter:** The 6th parameter to `handleOpenConceptTab` controls what view mode the new graph tab opens in. Default is `'children'`; passing `'flip'` opens decontextualized Flip View. **Gotcha:** When wrapping `handleOpenConceptTab` with an arrow function to inject `sourceCorpusTabId`, all remaining parameters must be passed through — otherwise new parameters added later get silently dropped.
115. **`tabType` Determined by `conceptId` Presence, Not Path Length:** In `handleOpenConceptTab`, `tabType` is `'concept'` when a `conceptId` is provided (even with empty path for decontextualized views), and `'root'` only when no `conceptId` is given. The previous logic (`path.length === 0 ? 'root' : 'concept'`) incorrectly created root-type tabs for decontextualized concept views.
116. **Disambiguation Picker Unnecessary Under Current Schema:** Concept names are globally unique in the `concepts` table. Different attributes exist on edges, not concepts. The decontextualized Flip View already shows all attribute contexts for a concept. Forcing users to pick an attribute before seeing anything would contradict Orca's exploration-first philosophy. If concept names become non-unique in the future, disambiguation can be added then.
117. **Live Concept Linking Uses 500ms Debounce:** During document editing and document upload, concept link matching fires 500ms after the user stops typing (same debounce pattern as SearchField). This balances responsiveness with avoiding excessive API calls.
118. **Concept Link Caching Uses Timestamp Comparison for Staleness:** Rather than eagerly invalidating caches when new concepts are created, the cache uses lazy invalidation: on document open, compare `computed_at` against `MAX(concepts.created_at)`. If any concept is newer, recompute. The cache is also invalidated (all rows deleted) whenever a document is edited (Phase 21a). First view after cache invalidation pays the recomputation cost; subsequent views are instant.
119. **Concept Links Use Cached Endpoint, Editing Uses Direct Matching:** Two distinct code paths serve concept links. Documents viewed normally call `GET /concepts/document-links/:documentId` (cache-backed, reads from DB). Document editing and upload call `POST /concepts/find-in-text` with the text body directly (live, no caching). This separation is clean because the cache is invalidated on every edit (Phase 21a) and recomputed on next view.
120. **Graph Votes Page Tabs Are Auto-Generated from Corpus Membership (Phase 7c Overhaul, renamed Phase 28c):** The Graph Votes page (formerly "Saved Page") no longer uses manually created tabs (`saved_tabs` / `vote_tab_links`). Instead, tabs are dynamically computed: one per corpus where the user has votes associated via annotations, plus an Uncategorized tab. Association is determined by walking annotations: if an edge (or any descendant voted edge) has an annotation in a corpus, the entire voted branch appears in that corpus tab. The backend propagates corpus associations upward from annotated edges to ancestor voted edges. No tab picker on the ▲ button — votes just vote.
121. **Corpus Association Propagates Upward Through Saved Ancestors:** When determining which corpus tab a saved edge belongs to on the Saved Page, the backend checks not only whether the edge itself has an annotation, but also whether any descendant saved edge in the same branch has an annotation. If child edge C has an annotation in Corpus X, then parent edge P (which is also saved) also appears in the Corpus X tab on the Saved Page. This ensures complete tree context is visible in each corpus tab.
122. **Partial Unique Indexes for NULL Corpus ID:** The `saved_tree_order_v2` table uses PostgreSQL partial unique indexes to handle the Uncategorized tab (NULL `corpus_id`). One index covers rows `WHERE corpus_id IS NOT NULL` (standard unique on `user_id, corpus_id, root_concept_id`), another covers rows `WHERE corpus_id IS NULL` (unique on `user_id, root_concept_id`). This avoids the PostgreSQL issue where NULL values are treated as distinct in regular UNIQUE constraints.
123. **Unsubscribed Corpus Tabs on Saved Page:** If a user unsubscribes from a corpus but still has saves associated with it via annotations, the corpus still appears as a tab on the Saved Page with an "unsubscribed" badge. The tab disappears automatically when all associated saves are removed. Each unsubscribed corpus gets its own tab (not a single "Unsubscribed" bucket).
124. **Backwards-Compatible Vote Tab Links During Transition:** The simplified `addVote` still creates `vote_tab_links` entries (linking new votes to the user's first `saved_tabs` tab) for backwards compatibility during the transition period. This keeps the old `removeVoteFromTab` endpoint functional if needed. Once the old saved tabs system is fully cleaned up, this backwards-compat code can be removed.
125. **Document Favoriting Is Per-Corpus, Per-User:** The `document_favorites` table uses `UNIQUE(user_id, corpus_id, document_id)` — favoriting a document in one corpus doesn't affect its position in other corpuses. This is intentional: different corpuses serve different purposes, and a document that's important in one context may be irrelevant in another. The toggle endpoint inserts or deletes in a single call (check-then-act pattern). Favorites are loaded alongside corpus data and sorted client-side.
126. **Search Surfacing Uses Two Independent Context Sources:** Search results can show both saved-tab badges (green, from `votes` → `vote_tab_links` → `saved_tabs`) and corpus annotation badges (blue, from `document_annotations` → `edges` → `corpus_subscriptions`). These are independent queries — a concept can appear in saved tabs without being annotated, or be annotated without being saved. Results with any context (either or both) sort to the top. The section header "In your saves / corpuses" covers both.
127. **Orphan Detection Is Query-Based, Not Table-Based:** No `pending_orphan_rescues` table is needed. Orphaned documents are detected on the fly by querying for documents where `uploaded_by = current_user` and no rows exist in `corpus_documents`. This avoids tracking deferred state, expiry windows, or background cleanup jobs. The tradeoff is a small number of zombie documents from users who never log in again, which is negligible.
128. **"Editorial" Layer Replaces "Private" Layer:** The formerly "private" annotation layer is renamed to "editorial" to reflect its actual purpose: a curated annotation layer maintained by allowed users. The key change: editorial-layer annotations are now **visible to ALL users** — anyone can read them. Only allowed users can *create* or *vote on* editorial-layer annotations. This aligns with Orca's transparency philosophy (everything public and inspectable). The `document_annotations.layer` column values change from `'private'` to `'editorial'`. The backend no longer filters out editorial annotations for non-allowed users — it only restricts write operations.
129. **Nested Corpuses Used Single-Parent Model (Phase 12a) — ⚠️ Removed in Phase 19a:** Corpuses were nested via a `parent_corpus_id` column. This was removed in Phase 19a — all corpuses are now flat/top-level. The original rationale is preserved here for historical context: single-parent model was chosen over multi-parent junction table for simplicity. The feature was ultimately removed because document organization is better handled by corpuses as flat containers, with users navigating between documents via graphs rather than folder hierarchies.
130. **Corpus Permissions Do Not Cascade Through Nesting:** Nesting corpuses is purely organizational. Being an allowed user of a parent corpus does NOT grant any special access to sub-corpuses. Each sub-corpus retains its own owner, allowed users, and invite tokens independently. This keeps permissions simple and predictable.
131. **Corpus Subscriptions Show Parent Only (Manual Expand):** Subscribing to a corpus shows only the parent in the sidebar. Users expand to discover sub-corpuses. This prevents tab bar clutter for large corpus trees and matches familiar file explorer UX. Expand/collapse state stored locally in React state (`expandedCorpusIds`).
132. **Graph Tabs Mixed Into Corpus Tree (Private Placement):** Users can place their graph tabs inside any corpus node in the sidebar tree. These placements are private — only visible to the placing user. A graph tab can only be placed in one corpus at a time (`UNIQUE(user_id, graph_tab_id)`). Placing in a corpus removes from any flat tab group (and vice versa). The `user_corpus_tab_placements` table tracks these placements.
133. **Tab Groups Retained for Corpus-Unaffiliated Graph Tabs:** The existing flat `tab_groups` system survives for graph tabs not placed in any corpus. The sidebar layout is: CORPUSES (with placed graph tabs inside) → GRAPH GROUPS → GRAPHS (ungrouped). Corpus tabs are no longer placed in flat tab groups — `corpus_subscriptions.group_id` is retired (cleared in migration).
134. **Cross-Annotation Path Linking Is Frontend-Only:** When a document has multiple annotations from the same concept graph, the annotation detail sidebar's path display becomes interactive — ancestor concepts that are also annotations become clickable, and descendant annotation concepts extend the path downward. This requires no new tables or endpoints; it cross-references the already-loaded annotations array to find path overlaps.
135. **Tab Activity API Response Uses camelCase:** The `GET /votes/tab-activity` endpoint returns `{ activity: [...] }` (not `activities`), and each activity object uses camelCase fields: `isDormant`, `corpusId`, `corpusName`, `lastOpenedAt`. This was discovered during Phase 10c when the dormancy banner initially didn't appear due to mismatched field names (`is_dormant` vs `isDormant`, `activities` vs `activity`).
136. **Annotation Path Cross-Referencing Requires Parallel ID Array (Phase 13):** The annotation enrichment stores `resolvedPathNames` (human-readable) and `resolvedPathIds` (concept IDs) as parallel arrays. Both are built from `graph_path` + `parent_id`. The ID array is essential for cross-referencing annotations in the sidebar — without it, name-based matching would be unreliable (same name could appear at different points in different graphs). Descendant detection uses `annotations.filter(a => a.graph_path.includes(currentChildId))` — checking if the current concept's `child_id` appears anywhere in another annotation's ancestor chain.
137. **`graph_path` Includes the Parent — Never Append Parent Separately (Phase 15d):** The `graph_path` array on every edge stores the full path from root to the parent concept, *inclusive of the parent at the end*. For example, edge `parent_id: 3, child_id: 4, graph_path: [1, 2, 3]` — the path includes parent concept 3. When resolving `graph_path` to display names, do NOT also append `parentName` or `parent_id` — the parent is already the last element. If displaying the parent separately from its ancestors (as FlipView does), use `graph_path.slice(0, -1)` for the ancestor chain above the parent. The leaf concept (child of the edge) is the only thing that should be appended after the resolved path. This was the root cause of duplicate concept names appearing in annotation paths, move vote paths, and annotation panel context pickers.
138. **Sub-Corpuses Are Not Independently Subscribable (Phase 15b) — ⚠️ Moot after Phase 19a:** This restriction is no longer relevant since sub-corpus infrastructure was removed entirely in Phase 19a. All corpuses are now top-level and subscribable.
139. **Sidebar Section Labels — ⚠️ Moot after Phase 19b:** The three sidebar sections (CORPUSES, GRAPH GROUPS, GRAPHS) were removed in Phase 19b and replaced with a single unlabeled unified list. Section header verification is no longer needed.
140. **Admin User Via Environment Variable (Phase 16):** The admin user for moderation (unhide) is determined by `ADMIN_USER_ID` in the backend `.env` file, not hardcoded. The `getHiddenChildren` endpoint returns an `isAdmin` boolean so the frontend conditionally renders the Unhide button without needing to know the admin ID itself. This keeps admin identity server-side only.
141. **Single-Flag Immediate Hide (Phase 16):** One flag from any logged-in user immediately hides an edge (`is_hidden = true`). This is intentionally aggressive for spam prevention — the community voting (hide/show) and admin unhide provide the correction mechanism. Future enhancement: community-threshold auto-unhide when show votes exceed hide votes by a configurable margin.
142. **Auth Middleware Default Export Pattern:** The auth middleware (`middleware/auth.js`) exports `authenticateToken` as the default export (`module.exports = authenticateToken`) and `optionalAuth` as a named property (`module.exports.optionalAuth = optionalAuth`). All route files must import as `const authenticateToken = require('../middleware/auth')` — NOT destructured `{ authenticateToken }`. This has caused startup crashes when forgotten (Phase 16a).
143. **Hidden Edge Filtering Scope (Phase 16b):** The `is_hidden` filter is applied to all public-facing *display* queries (children, roots, parents, vote sets, diff, search child-check, Jaccard similarity) but NOT to user-specific data queries (Saved Page, vote removal). Users can still see and unsave their own saved edges even if the edge is subsequently hidden. Write operations (save, web link, annotation) are blocked on hidden edges as a safety net.
144. **Root Concept Root-Detection Subquery Is NOT Hidden-Filtered (Phase 16b):** The `getRootConcepts` query uses `WHERE c.id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT child_id FROM edges WHERE parent_id IS NOT NULL)` to find concepts that aren't children anywhere. This subquery intentionally does NOT filter `is_hidden` — a concept that's a child somewhere (even if that child edge is hidden) should not suddenly appear as a new root concept. Only the root *edge* join (`root_e`) filters hidden.
145. **Document Tags Are Global, Not Per-Corpus (Phase 17):** Tags live on documents, not on corpus–document links. A tag assigned to a document is visible everywhere that document appears (all corpuses, External Links page). This reflects the design principle that a document's type (preprint, protocol, etc.) is an intrinsic property of the document, not of its membership in a particular corpus. Any logged-in user can create tags and assign them. Removal is restricted to the user who assigned the tag or any owner of a corpus the document belongs to. The `documents.js` route file was created in Phase 17a, consolidating the previously standalone `GET /api/documents/:id` route from `server.js` with the new tag endpoints. **Updated Phase 27e:** Tag creation is now admin-controlled — `POST /tags/create` returns 410 Gone; tags are seeded in migrate.js and filtered by `ENABLED_DOCUMENT_TAGS` env var.
146. **Overlay/Tab Visibility Coupling — Three Mutually Exclusive Content Areas (Phase 17 bugfix):** The app has three mutually exclusive content areas: saved page (`savedPageOpen`), corpus overlay (`corpusView`), and graph/corpus tab content (shown when the other two are falsy). **Any click handler that switches between these modes must explicitly clear the other two states.** Failing to do so causes the old overlay to render on top, making the new content invisible. This was the root cause of graph tabs being unclickable while the corpus browse was open. Rule: whenever adding a new navigation action (sidebar click, button, etc.), verify it resets all three of `activeTab`, `corpusView`, and `savedPageOpen` as appropriate.
147. **Don't Use Render Depth as Proxy for Semantic Identity (Phase 17 bugfix):** `renderSidebarCorpusItem` used `depth === 0` to mean "this is a subscribed top-level corpus" and `depth > 0` to mean "this is a sub-corpus". But a subscribed corpus tab can render at `depth=1` inside a group. **Always use the authoritative data source (`corpusTabs`) to classify items, not their position in the visual tree.** The fix replaced all `depth === 0` guards with `corpusTabs.some(t => t.id === tab.id)`.
148. **Error Fallback Paths Must Be Safe for Destructive Actions (Phase 17 bugfix):** The sub-corpus document opening walk-up had a catch block that logged a warning then fell through to `handleSubscribeToCorpus` with the sub-corpus ID — which the backend was guaranteed to reject. **When a try/catch guards an action whose inputs depend on async resolution, the catch should abort the action (`return`), not silently proceed with whatever the inputs happen to be.**
149. **CorpusDetailView and CorpusTabContent Document Cards Must Show Identical Information (Phase 17 bugfix):** Two separate views render document cards: `CorpusDetailView` (Corpuses browse page) and `CorpusTabContent` (corpus tabs in sidebar). Both must display the same metadata: title, format, uploader, date, version badge, draft badge, and tag pills. When adding a new document-level feature (like tags), both components must be updated. This has already regressed once (version/draft badges were in `CorpusTabContent` but missing from `CorpusDetailView`).
150. **Grouped Corpus Tabs Must Render Inside Groups (Phase 17 bugfix):** `renderSidebarGroup` must render both `graphTabs` and `corpusTabs` that have matching `group_id`. The auto-grouping flow in `handleOpenConceptTab` sets `group_id` on corpus subscriptions, moving them out of the ungrouped CORPUSES section. If `renderSidebarGroup` only renders graph tabs, grouped corpus tabs disappear entirely. `groupContainsActiveTab` must also check corpus tabs, not just graph tabs.
151. **Flip View Path Highlighting Uses Hover, Not Click (Phase 18):** The original spec called for click-based path segment selection with Ctrl+click for multi-segment support. This was revised to hover because Flip View cards are entirely clickable for navigation — adding click-based path selection would create a UX conflict (users would accidentally navigate when trying to highlight, or vice versa). Hover is zero-commitment, instantly discoverable, and needs no mode switching. The tradeoff is that multi-segment selection (Ctrl+click) is not possible with hover, but this is acceptable because the contiguous shared segment extension already shows the most useful information automatically. The `getSharedSegments` algorithm has O(n×m) complexity per card pair, but Flip View rarely exceeds ~30 cards, so performance is not a concern.
152. **`graph_path` Parent Duplication Is a Recurring Bug Pattern (Phase 20 fix):** When building annotation path displays from `graph_path`, the parent concept is already the last element of the array. Code that then separately pushes `parentName`/`parent_id` causes duplicate names. This bug has appeared in at least three places: `CorpusTabContent.jsx`, `DecontextualizedDocView.jsx`, and annotation panel context pickers. When writing new path display code, always check: does the array already end with the parent? If so, do NOT append it again. See Architecture Decision #137 for the canonical rule.
153. **Annotation Sentence Expansion Capped at 200 Characters (Phase 20d):** When showing annotation context in the former `WebLinksView.jsx` (now retired in Phase 27a), the sentence boundary scan was capped at 200 characters in each direction from the annotation. If no punctuation was found within the cap, an ellipsis (`…`) was appended. This pattern may still be referenced in annotation display code elsewhere.
154. **Document-Level Annotations Replace Offset-Based Highlighting (Phase 22b):** Annotations no longer store `start_position`/`end_position` character offsets. Instead they attach a concept-in-context to the whole document with an optional `quote_text` string and optional `comment`. Quote navigation uses runtime string search, not stored offsets. This eliminates offset fragility on document edits/versions, removes `buildAnnotatedBody` segment rendering, and better fits value-graph annotation where the concept–document connection is conceptual. Existing offset-based annotations are migrated by extracting the highlighted substring into `quote_text`.
155. **Concept Detection Panel Replaces Persistent Underlines (Phase 22b):** Graphed concept names in document text were previously rendered as persistent underlines with complex annotation-vs-concept-link priority logic. Replaced by a sidebar panel listing detected concepts with navigate buttons (scroll-to and temporary highlight). Keeps the document body clean, eliminates overlap logic, and makes concept detection more actionable.
156. **Quote Occurrence Picker for Ambiguous Navigation (Phase 22b):** When a text quote or concept name appears multiple times in a document, clicking "navigate" shows an occurrence picker with surrounding context. The annotator selects which occurrence they mean, stored as `quote_occurrence`. Avoids character offsets while allowing precise navigation. Stale quotes (post-versioning) gracefully degrade to non-clickable context text.
157. **pdf-parse v1.1.1 Required, Not v2.x (Phase 22a):** The `pdf-parse` npm package v2.x rearchitected its API — the `/node` entry exported only `{ getHeader }` and the main entry crashed with `DOMMatrix is not defined` (browser-only). v1.1.1 exports the parse function directly and works in Node.js. Always `require('pdf-parse')` (not `require('pdf-parse/node')`).
158. **Remove process.exit from pg Pool Error Handler (Phase 22a):** The `database.js` pg pool `error` event handler had `process.exit(-1)` which killed the backend on any transient PostgreSQL client error (network hiccup, idle timeout). The pg pool handles reconnection automatically — the process should log errors, not exit. This caused all API calls (including login) to return 500 after any transient DB error.
159. **window.document Shadowed by React State Variable (Phase 22b):** In `CorpusTabContent.jsx`, the React state variable `document` (holding `{ id, title, body, ... }`) shadows the global `window.document` DOM API. All DOM API calls (`createTreeWalker`, `createRange`, `createElement`) must use `window.document.*` explicitly. This caused a `createTreeWalker is not a function` crash in the quote navigation feature.
160. **Two-Column Concept Layout with Context-Scoped Annotations (Phase 27a):** The concept page now splits into a 65/35 flex layout when viewing a specific concept (not root). Left column: children or flip view. Right column: `ConceptAnnotationPanel.jsx` with Annotations and Web Links tabs. The header (breadcrumb, attribute badge, save button) stays full-width above both columns. Both columns scroll independently. The right panel only renders when `effectiveConceptId` is set — root page stays full-width. The panel accepts a `viewMode` prop: in children view, annotations are scoped to the current edge only (`?edgeId=N`); in flip view, annotations from all contexts are shown.
161. **Cross-Context Annotation Aggregation (Phase 27b, updated Phase 40):** `GET /api/concepts/:id/annotations` finds all `document_annotations` joined through edges where `child_id = :conceptId` and `is_hidden = false`. Each annotation includes a `context` object (`edgeId`, `parentId`, `parentName`, `pathNames`, `attributeName`) so the user can see which parent context each annotation came from. The endpoint supports composable filters: `?edgeId=N` (single context), `?corpusIds=1,2,3`, `?tagId=N`, `?sort=votes|subscribed|newest`. The `subscribed` sort ranks annotations by votes from members of the user's subscribed corpuses (requires auth). Path names are resolved via batch concept name lookup. The context path displayed in the panel includes the leaf concept name (appended in frontend `renderContextPath`).
162. **Annotation Panel Shows Read-Only Vote Counts (Phase 27b):** The ConceptAnnotationPanel shows annotation endorsement counts and web link vote counts as plain text, not interactive buttons. Users must navigate to the document in a corpus tab to vote. This keeps the panel focused on discovery/navigation rather than duplicating the voting UI.
163. **Auto-Subscribe on Annotation Click-Through (Phase 27c, updated Phase 28, Phase 50b):** When a logged-in user clicks an annotation card in ConceptAnnotationPanel, AppShell calls `handleSubscribeToCorpus` which subscribes to the corpus (or handles 409 if already subscribed), creates/finds a corpus tab in the sidebar, sets `pendingCorpusDocumentId` and `pendingAnnotationId`, and switches to the tab. CorpusTabContent watches for the pending annotation in its loaded annotations array, selects it, and triggers `navigateToOccurrence` on the quote text (with 300ms delay for DOM render). Guests see a login modal with "Log in to view documents and annotations" (updated Phase 28 — previously opened DecontextualizedDocView overlay). Phase 50b extended this handler with a local short-circuit: if a tab already exists for the corpus, skip the subscribe API call entirely and just set pending state + switch tabs. The 409 catch is retained as a race-condition backstop. This also silences console noise on Phase 27c annotation click-through, Phase 38h "Add as Annotation," and Phase 50b reverse-citation click-through, all of which route through the same handler.
164. **Pending Annotation Must Not Trigger Creation UI (Phase 27c bugfix):** When consuming `pendingAnnotationId` in CorpusTabContent, the effect must set `showAnnotationPanel(false)` — not `true`. Setting it to `true` opens the AnnotationPanel creation form (QUOTE/COMMENT/CONCEPT fields) instead of just selecting the annotation in the sidebar list. The pending flow should: open the document → scroll to quote → select the annotation in the sidebar → NOT open creation UI.
165. **Pending Document Must Override Currently-Open Document (Phase 27c bugfix):** When `pendingCorpusDocumentId` points to a document different from the one already open in the corpus tab, the pending document effect must trigger even if `subView !== 'list'`. The fix extends the effect condition to also fire when the current document ID differs from the pending one, navigating to the new document before applying `pendingAnnotationId`.
166. **Admin-Controlled Document Tags Replace User-Created Tags (Phase 27e):** `POST /api/documents/tags/create` now returns 410 Gone. `GET /api/documents/tags` filters by `ENABLED_DOCUMENT_TAGS` env var (case-insensitive comma-separated names). If the env var is empty or unset, all tags are returned (backwards compatible). Initial tags seeded in migrate.js: preprint, protocol, grant application, review article, dataset, thesis, textbook, lecture notes, commentary. "Create new tag" UI removed from CorpusTabContent tag pickers. Mirrors the `ENABLED_ATTRIBUTES` pattern from Phase 25e.
167. **Responsive Concept Layout (Phase 27d):** Below 900px viewport width, the two-column layout switches to vertical stacking (`flexDirection: 'column'`). The right panel loses its left border and gains a top border. The panel becomes collapsible via a clickable "Annotations & Links ▸/▾" header, defaulting to collapsed on narrow screens. Uses `window.matchMedia` with a change listener, cleaned up on unmount.
168. **Retired View Modes and Components (Phase 27a):** The `'links'` and `'fliplinks'` view modes are retired. `WebLinksView.jsx` (Phase 6b) and `FlipLinksView.jsx` (Phase 6c) are deleted. The 🔗 Links button in the concept header and the "🔗 All Links" button in FlipView.jsx are removed. A migration step in migrate.js updates any `graph_tabs` rows with `view_mode = 'links'` or `'fliplinks'` to `'children'`. Web links and cross-context annotations are now served by ConceptAnnotationPanel in the right column.
169. **DocumentPage.jsx — ❌ REMOVED (Phase 28):** The standalone document page at `/documents/:id` was deleted along with `DecontextualizedDocView.jsx`. The route was removed from App.jsx. Guest annotation card clicks now open the login modal (Phase 28f) with the notice "Log in to view documents and annotations" instead of showing a standalone document view. The callback chain is: `ConceptAnnotationPanel.onRequestLogin` → `Concept.onRequestLogin` → `AppShell.handleRequestLogin` → opens the login modal.
170. **Login Modal Replaces Login/Register Pages (Phase 28f, updated Phase 32c):** `LoginModal.jsx` is a centered overlay modal with semi-transparent backdrop, two tabs (Log In / Sign Up), dismissable via backdrop click or Escape. As of Phase 32c, uses phone OTP two-step flow (`sendCode` → `phoneRegister`/`phoneLogin` via AuthContext) instead of username/password. Accepts a `notice` prop for contextual messages (e.g., "You have a pending corpus invite..."). The `/login` and `/register` routes in App.jsx redirect to `/`. `AcceptInvite.jsx` and `DocInviteAccept.jsx` show the login modal for guests. `Login.jsx` and `Register.jsx` files are retained but unused. Old `login()`/`register()` functions removed from AuthContext in Phase 32d.
171. **Child Rankings Retired (Phase 28b):** The `child_rankings` table remains in the database (append-only philosophy) but the ranking UI is removed. The backend `getVoteSets` no longer returns ranking-related data for the frontend. Individual vote set filtering still works; only the per-child rank dropdown and aggregated rank badges are removed. Ranking cleanup queries in `removeVote`, `removeVoteFromTab`, and `addSwapVote` were also cleaned up.
172. **Super-Groups Retired (Phase 28b):** Vote set similarity grouping (Layer 3 — super-groups with agglomerative hierarchical clustering) is removed from the frontend. The underlying `getVoteSets` endpoint still returns vote set data, but super-group computation and the two-row swatch layout are removed. Individual vote set swatches and filtering remain.
173. **"Graph Votes" Replaces "Saved" Terminology (Phase 28c):** All user-facing "Saved" / "saves" / "saved" text is renamed: sidebar button → "Graph Votes", page heading → "Graph Votes", count labels → "graph votes", sort dropdown → "↓ Votes", SwapModal → "vote/votes", VoteSetBar tooltip → "users voted for the same", annotation panel → "▲ N votes", FlipView badge → "Voted". The internal code (variable names, API endpoints, database tables) retains the original "save"/"vote" naming — only UI-facing strings changed. Browser tab `<title>` changed from "Concept Hierarchy" to "orca".
174. **PostgreSQL COUNT() Returns String (Phase 28 bugfix):** The `pg` driver returns `COUNT()` as a string (e.g., `"1"` not `1`). Strict equality (`=== 1`) fails silently. Always wrap with `Number()` before numeric comparison. This caused the child count display to always show "children" instead of "child" for single-child concepts (ConceptGrid.jsx).
175. **Dormancy Banner Orphaned Activity Rows (Phase 28 bugfix):** The `getTabActivity` API returned ALL `saved_page_tab_activity` rows for a user, including orphaned rows for tabs where the user no longer has any actual saves. The `check-dormancy.js` script would mark these empty tabs dormant after 30 days, triggering the dormancy warning banner with nothing to act on. Fix: added `EXISTS` subquery filters so `getTabActivity` only returns activity rows backed by real saves — uncategorized tab requires at least one vote, corpus tabs require at least one vote on an edge with annotations in that corpus.
176. **Zen Aesthetic Rules (Phase 28a):** The UI uses a strict black-on-off-white theme with EB Garamond serif font. Rules: (1) No emoji icons in UI chrome — all emoji (📚📋📌🏷👥🔗🔄🚫🚩👁) replaced with text labels; only ▲ (save/vote) and ⇄ (swap) retained as geometric symbols; plain Unicode (←→▸▾✕↓) kept as simple shapes. (2) No colored buttons — green, red, blue buttons all converted to transparent/dark with neutral borders. (3) No italics — all `fontStyle: 'italic'` removed across 22 files (87 instances). (4) Font explicitly set on breadcrumbs, concept names, child counts, flip/share/sort buttons, login/register/logout buttons via inline `fontFamily`. (5) The only color in the UI comes from vote set swatches and dots.
177. **Document Search Excludes Superseded Versions (Phase 28d bugfix):** The `searchDocuments` query now adds `AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM documents d2 WHERE d2.source_document_id = d.id)` to exclude older document versions that have been superseded by newer versions. This prevents duplicate results when searching for documents.
178. **Annotation Lists Sorted by Vote Count (Phase 28d):** Both `CorpusTabContent.jsx` (contextualized view) and the now-removed `DecontextualizedDocView.jsx` sort annotation lists by `vote_count` descending. The `getAllDocumentAnnotations` backend endpoint now includes `vote_count` (via subquery on `annotation_votes`) in the response, with accumulation across merged duplicate annotations.
179. **Corpus Member Username Visibility (Phase 28e, updates #39):** Within a corpus, all corpus members (owner AND allowed users) can see each other's usernames in the members panel. The backend checks `corpus_allowed_users` membership (not just ownership) and returns the full username list plus `isOwner` and `isMember` flags. Invite link generation and member removal remain owner-only. Non-members still see count only. The Leave button is shown for allowed users who aren't the owner.
180. **Password Login Modal (Phase 32c, redesigned Phase 40b):** `LoginModal.jsx` has three modes: (1) **Log In** — identifier (username or email) + password form with "Forgot password?" link; (2) **Sign Up** — 3-step flow: phone number → OTP verification → username + email + password + confirm + age checkbox; (3) **Forgot Password** — 3-step flow: phone number → OTP verification → new password + confirm. Password fields have show/hide toggle. All passwords validated with zxcvbn (score >= 2, 8-128 chars). Phone OTP is only used during registration (to verify the phone is real) and password reset (to prove identity). Normal login uses password only — no OTP. `logoutEverywhere` in AppShell header does API call then local cleanup unconditionally — ensures user is always logged out locally even if the server call fails.
181. **Graceful Shutdown in server.js:** `server.js` registers `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` handlers that call `server.close()` before exiting. This ensures port 5000 is released cleanly when the process is stopped or when nodemon restarts after a crash. Without this, stale Node processes hold the port and cause `EADDRINUSE` errors on restart.
182. **Email Column Reactivated for Legal Notifications (Phase 36):** The `email` column on `users` was retired in Phase 32d but is reactivated in Phase 36 for legal notifications (copyright violations, ToS updates). Required for new registrations at application level; DB column stays nullable for backward compatibility. Not used for auth — phone OTP remains the only auth mechanism. No uniqueness constraint on email.
183. **Add as Annotation from Graph View (Phase 38h):** Users can annotate documents with the current concept directly from the graph view without navigating to the document first. The "Add as Annotation" button (children view only, logged-in users with a context) opens `AnnotateFromGraphPicker.jsx`, a lightweight corpus/document picker that shows subscribed corpuses with their documents and existing annotations for duplicate prevention. Selecting a document triggers the pending-document navigation pattern: `AppShell.handleAnnotateFromGraph` auto-subscribes if needed, sets `pendingCorpusDocumentId` + `pendingAnnotationFromGraph`, switches to the corpus tab. `CorpusTabContent` opens the document and the annotation creation panel with concept/edge pre-filled via `prefilledConcept`/`prefilledEdge` props on `AnnotationPanel.jsx`. The user can then see the document body, add quote text and comments, and confirm.
184. **Annotation Citation Links (Phase 38j, reverse direction added Phase 50):** Users can copy a citation URL for any annotation via a "Cite" button on annotation cards. Citation URLs use the format `/cite/a/{annotationId}`. When a document containing citation URLs is uploaded, the backend scans the body text via regex, resolves each annotation ID, and stores rows in `document_citation_links` with snapshot metadata (concept name, quote text, document title, corpus name). The "Cited Annotations" section in `CorpusTabContent` shows detected citations with live data when available or snapshot data with "(no longer available)" when the cited annotation has been deleted. Clicking a citation card navigates to the source document in the correct corpus. The `/cite/a/:annotationId` route is handled by `CitationRedirect.jsx` which resolves the annotation to its corpus/document context. **Phase 50 added the reverse direction:** annotation cards display a "Cited by N" badge when other documents cite them, and the expanded view lazy-loads a list of citing documents via `GET /api/annotations/:id/cited-by`. See Architecture Decisions #269 and #270 for the reverse-direction design choices.
185. **Search Corpus Badge Tooltips Include Document Titles (Phase 38k):** The corpus annotation badges on search results now include hover tooltips showing the specific document title(s) where the concept is annotated. The tooltip is rendered via `ReactDOM.createPortal` into `document.body` with `position: fixed` to avoid affecting the search dropdown layout. The backend `searchConcepts` endpoint's corpus annotation surfacing query JOINs `documents` to collect titles per corpus.
186. **Combos Are Browsable and Subscribable (Phase 39b):** The "Browse Combos" button in the sidebar opens a full-page overlay (`ComboListView.jsx`) with search, sort (Subscribers/New), subscribe/unsubscribe, and combo creation. Guest users can browse but not subscribe. Clicking a combo name auto-subscribes and switches to the combo tab. Sidebar action buttons use a 2x2 grid layout to accommodate four buttons (Graph Votes, Browse Corpuses, Browse Combos, Messages).
187. **Combo Tabs Are Persistent with display:none Pattern (Phase 39c):** All subscribed combo tabs are mounted simultaneously and hidden with `display: none` when inactive, matching corpus and graph tab patterns. This preserves scroll position, loaded data, and filter state across tab switches. Combo tabs appear in the sidebar unified list and are orderable via drag-and-drop.
188. **ComboTabContent Uses refreshKey for Cross-Component Reload (Phase 39e):** When an edge is added to a combo from the graph view ("Add to Combo" button in Concept.jsx), AppShell increments a `comboRefreshKey` counter passed to all `ComboTabContent` instances. The effect dependency on `refreshKey` triggers a data reload, so the combo tab shows the new subconcept immediately without a manual refresh.
189. **Add to Combo from Graph View (Phase 39d):** The "Add to Combo" button in the concept header appears when the user is logged in, owns at least one combo, and has a valid `parentEdgeId`. Single-combo shortcut: if the user owns exactly one combo, clicking adds directly without a picker. Multi-combo picker: a small floating dropdown anchored below the button. Feedback states: "Added ✓" (1.5s), "Already in combo" (2s), or error message. The picker closes on outside click or Escape.
190. **Invite Link Generation Supports Optional Limits (Phase 39e):** The "+ New Invite Link" button in `CorpusMembersPanel` now toggles an inline form with optional "Max uses" and "Expires in days" fields. Both fields are optional — leaving them blank creates an unlimited, non-expiring link (backwards compatible). The backend already supported `maxUses` and `expiresInDays` parameters since Phase 7g; only the frontend form was missing.
191. **Subscribed Sort Option for Annotations (Phase 40):** A "Subscribed" sort option ranks annotations by votes from members of corpuses the user subscribes to. "Members" = corpus owners (`corpuses.created_by`) UNION allowed users (`corpus_allowed_users.user_id`) for all corpuses in `corpus_subscriptions` for the current user. Each backend controller (`corpusController`, `conceptsController`, `comboController`) builds a `subscribed_members` CTE via this chain, then computes `subscribed_vote_count` per annotation by counting matching `annotation_votes`. The sort toggle appears in three views: CorpusTabContent (Votes | Subscribed | Position), ConceptAnnotationPanel (Top | Subscribed | New), and ComboTabContent (Combo Votes | Subscribed | New | Annotation Votes). Hidden for guest users (requires auth to resolve subscriptions). Secondary sort is always total `vote_count` descending.
192. **Password Login Replaces OTP Login (Phase 40b):** Normal login uses username/email + password via `POST /auth/login`. Phone OTP is used only during registration (to verify the phone is real) and during password reset (to prove identity). The `verify-login` endpoint is removed. The `password_hash` column on `users` (dormant since Phase 32d) is reactivated. Passwords are hashed with bcryptjs (10 salt rounds). The login endpoint accepts either username or email as the identifier, detecting which one via the presence of `@`. Login rate-limited to 10 req/IP/15 min.
193. **Password Strength via zxcvbn (Phase 40b):** Passwords must be at least 8 characters (max 128) and score >= 2 on the zxcvbn scale (0-4). This follows NIST SP 800-63B recommendations: enforce minimum length, check against common/breached passwords, but do NOT require arbitrary complexity rules (uppercase, special chars, etc.). The zxcvbn library is passed the user's username and email as penalty inputs so passwords containing the user's own info are scored lower. The zxcvbn feedback messages are returned directly to the frontend for display.
194. **Forgot Password Uses Phone Number as Identifier (Phase 40b):** The forgot-password flow requires the user to enter their phone number (not username/email) because phone numbers are stored as irreversible hashes (bcrypt + HMAC). The system cannot look up a user's phone number from their username to send an OTP. The phone number serves as both the identifier and the verification channel. The endpoint returns a generic success message regardless of whether the phone exists (security best practice to prevent account enumeration).
195. **ORCID Verified via OAuth Only (Phase 41a):** Users cannot manually type an ORCID iD. Per ORCID's integration requirements, iDs must be authenticated via the OAuth flow. The profile page has a "Connect ORCID" button, not a text input. The flow: frontend redirects to ORCID → user authenticates → ORCID redirects back with authorization code → backend exchanges code for verified ORCID iD via server-to-server token exchange → stores `orcid_id` on user row.
196. **ORCID Access Tokens Not Stored (Phase 41a):** Orca only uses the `/authenticate` scope to get the verified ORCID iD. The access token from the OAuth exchange is used once and discarded. Orca never reads or writes ORCID record data — it only confirms the iD belongs to the user.
197. **Profile Page Is Read-Only for Others (Phase 41a):** Any user (including guests) can view a profile page at `/profile/:userId` to see username, ORCID link, and public stats (corpus count, document count). Only the profile owner sees the "Connect/Disconnect ORCID" button. Username in the AppShell header links to the user's own profile.
198. **ORCID Uniqueness at Application Level (Phase 41a):** A unique partial index on `users.orcid_id WHERE orcid_id IS NOT NULL` prevents two users from linking the same ORCID. The backend returns 409 Conflict if a duplicate is attempted.
199. **ORCID Badge Placement Is Strategic (Phase 41b):** ORCID icons appear only where a username represents authorship or membership — document uploaders, corpus members/owners, annotation creators, and corpus list/detail views. They do NOT appear in every username occurrence (e.g., not in the AppShell header, not in page comments, not in moderation views). The badge is a small green ORCID iD icon (16x16px) that links to the user's ORCID profile in a new tab.
200. **Multiple External Links Per Document via Root Document (Phase 41c):** External links use a separate `document_external_links` table rather than a column on `documents`. This allows multiple links (arXiv, DOI, journal URL, etc.) per document. Links are stored against the root document in the version chain — all versions share one set of links automatically, with no propagation needed. This follows the same pattern as `document_authors`.
201. **External Links Authors-Only Edit (Phase 41c):** Only the document uploader (`uploaded_by`) or co-authors (`document_authors`) can add or remove external links. Corpus owners cannot — this is the author's metadata about their work. Duplicate URLs on the same document are rejected (409 Conflict).
202. **External Links Displayed Below Document Metadata (Phase 41c):** External links render at the top of the document viewer in CorpusTabContent, below the title/metadata row and above the document body. Each link shows a truncated URL (60 char max) with an external link arrow (↗). Authors see ✕ remove buttons and an "+ Add source link" toggle. Links are not shown in the upload form — authors add them after upload via the document viewer.
203. **Direct Add for Corpus Invite by Username/ORCID (Phase 41d):** Searching by username or ORCID adds the user directly to `corpus_allowed_users`, skipping an accept/decline flow. This is simpler than building a notification system and mirrors how invite links work (the owner generates the access; the user just shows up). Users can always "Leave corpus" if added unwantedly.
204. **User Search Requires Authentication (Phase 41d):** The `GET /api/users/search` endpoint requires login. This prevents anonymous scraping of usernames and ORCID associations. Username search is prefix-match (ILIKE), ORCID search is exact match. Max 10 results, excludes the requesting user.
205. **ORCID Search Is Exact Match (Phase 41d):** When the search query looks like an ORCID iD (digits with dashes), the backend does an exact match on `users.orcid_id`. No fuzzy matching on ORCID iDs — they're precise identifiers.
206. **Superconcepts Are a UI Rename Only (Phase 42a):** All user-facing text changes from "combo" to "superconcept" but all internal identifiers (database tables, API routes, component file names, variable names) remain as "combo". This avoids a risky mass-rename across the codebase while giving users the right conceptual framing.
207. **Document Coauthor Direct Add Mirrors Corpus Pattern (Phase 42b):** Adding a coauthor by username/ORCID search directly inserts into `document_authors`, skipping an accept/decline flow. This matches the corpus invite-by-search pattern from Phase 41d. Coauthors can leave via the existing "Leave" button if added unwantedly.
208. **Superconcept Transfer Target Is Any User (Phase 42c):** Unlike corpus transfer (which requires the target to be an existing `corpus_allowed_users` member), superconcept transfer allows any user as the target. Superconcepts don't have a formal membership model — only subscribers — so requiring the target to be a subscriber would be unnecessarily restrictive.
209. **Auto-Subscribe New Superconcept Owner (Phase 42c):** When ownership transfers, if the new owner is not already a subscriber, they are automatically subscribed (row in `combo_subscriptions` + `sidebar_items`). An owner should always have access to manage their superconcept via the sidebar.
210. **Account Deletion Requires Zero Owned Superconcepts (Phase 42c):** The `delete-account` endpoint now checks for both owned corpuses and owned superconcepts. This replaces the previous behavior where combo ownership silently became ownerless via `ON DELETE SET NULL` (Architecture Decision #225 updated). The `ON DELETE SET NULL` FK constraint remains as a defensive measure.
211. **Corpus Members Can Remove Their Own Documents (Phase 42d):** The document removal endpoint checks `corpus_documents.added_by` in addition to corpus ownership. Members can retract documents they contributed without requiring the corpus owner to act. Same orphan cleanup behavior applies. Members cannot remove documents added by other members or by the owner.
212. **Tunnel Links Are Bidirectional, Votes Are Directional (Phase 43):** Creating a tunnel link between edges A and B inserts two `tunnel_links` rows (A→B and B→A) in a single transaction. Both directions are visible immediately. Votes are independent per direction — voting for B in A's tunnel view does not affect A in B's tunnel view. This allows asymmetric relevance assertions.
213. **Tunnel View Hides Annotation Panel (Phase 43b):** When `effectiveViewMode === 'tunnel'`, the right column (`ConceptAnnotationPanel`) does not render and the left column takes full width. The annotation panel returns when switching back to children or flip view.
214. **Tunnel Button Requires Parent Edge Context (Phase 43b):** The "Tunnel" button in the concept header only appears when `effectiveViewMode === 'children' && parentEdgeId` is truthy. Root concepts without a path have no edge to tunnel from. Root concepts navigated to WITH a path (via a graph path) DO have an edge and show the button.
215. **Tunnel Links TO Hidden Edges Still Display (Phase 43c):** The `getTunnelLinks` query has no `is_hidden` filter on the linked edge. This matches the superconcept philosophy (Architecture Decision #222) — the user who created the tunnel made a deliberate choice. Creating tunnels to hidden edges IS blocked (validation in `createTunnelLink`).
216. **FlipView Right-Click Opens New Graph Tab (Phase 43b):** Alt parent cards in FlipView support right-click context menu with "Open in new graph tab". Left click still navigates the current tab (Phase 38a behavior). The `onOpenNewTab` prop is optional — if not provided (standalone mode), right-click does nothing special.

### Common Tasks

**Adding a new API endpoint:**
1. Create controller function in `backend/src/controllers/`
2. Add route in `backend/src/routes/`
3. Add API method in `frontend/src/services/api.js`

**Adding a new page:**
1. Create component in `frontend/src/pages/`
2. Add route in `frontend/src/App.jsx`
3. Link to it from other pages

**Database changes:**
1. Modify `backend/src/config/migrate.js`
2. Drop and recreate database (for now)
3. Later: use proper migrations

## Organizational Philosophy

**Commons Model**
As a platform that hosts user generated content, Orca's approach to content moderation and curation revolves around community norms over top down executive decisions and curious discovery over algorithmic curation. The placement and movement of saves is the primary signal to high quality concept paths. We want to enable users to use those signals wisely to assert a tasteful preference for high quality content in Orca. Part of that is discussing and asserting community norms. Orca users should strive for this active sense of civic engagement with the community. Find communities in which you can be an active citizen. Pursuit of Wikipedia-like governing and structuring activity to the graphs. 

**Using Language As a Tool**
'In most cases, the meaning of a word is its use.' Concepts are functional entities in Orca. They connect to both parent and child concepts and help direct human energy in productive ways. They add clarity and flexibility to the conceptual model of actions and other concepts. Every concept in Orca carries one of four attributes: **action**, **tool**, **value**, or **question**. Actions are the default concept type — steps, workflows, things you do. Tools differentiate the means by which actions are carried out. Values represent motivations, principles, and differentiators that guide why and how actions are pursued. Questions capture research questions — open inquiries that organize investigation and exploration within a domain. A user might apply a value as a root concept to contain actions that 'enact' it, or as a child of an action to specify substeps or tools that uniquely pursue that value. These attributes allow users to tag concepts within a shared graph, so that `Reading [action]` and `Book [tool]` can coexist as siblings in the same hierarchy. The hierarchical relationships come to represent the order in which these things are thought about during real decision making. This maintains the collective action ontology spirit: an action scaffolding that can be enriched with tools, values, and questions. The basic level is the most efficient to talk about for a given purpose; the idea is to expand upward into goals and downward into detailed descriptions.

## Permanence & Moderation Rules

### Nothing Is Ever Deleted
- **Concepts** are never deleted, only hidden (via spam/vandalism flagging)
- **Edges** are never deleted, only hidden (via spam/vandalism flagging)
- Hidden items have talk pages for accountability and community discussion
- Low-saved content stays visible — saving and hiding are completely separate systems

### Hiding System (Spam/Abuse Only)
- Hiding is for spam, vandalism, offensive content, or illegal activity — NOT for low-quality or unpopular content
- Low-saved concepts remain visible to encourage new ideas and organic discovery
- **Namespace blocking:** If a concept is hidden in a specific path + attribute context, that exact namespace is blocked. You cannot recreate an identically-named concept with the same attribute in that same path until it is unhidden.
- Hidden concepts/edges can be unhidden if the community decides the flag was wrong

### Graph Votes Page Stability (formerly "Saved Page")
- The Graph Votes page shows only the user's own votes, organized across corpus-based tabs — this list is stable unless the user explicitly votes or unvotes
- The dynamism is in the *child sets* of the user's voted leaf nodes — those evolve as other users add content — but the user's bookmarked list itself does not churn
- Unvoting cascades: removing a concept (via X button on Graph Votes page or unvoting in children view) also removes all descendants in that branch, with vote counts subtracted accordingly

### Documented Exception: Company-Initiated Legal Removal (Phase 53)
The append-only "Nothing Is Ever Deleted" rule governs **user-driven** deletion and the **community** moderation system (hide/unhide via flags and votes). It does NOT apply to Company-initiated removal in response to legal obligation — DMCA takedown notices, content the Company has actual knowledge is illegal, or court orders. Phase 53 (✅ COMPLETE) builds the audited, admin-only mechanism for these cases. Legally-removed content sets a `legal_hold` flag (where applicable) that prevents community unhide. Intake audit trail lives in `copyright_infringement_notices` and `copyright_counter_notices`. The admin removal audit table (`legal_removals`) tracks every removal with full provenance. The `dmca_strikes` table tracks per-user DMCA strikes with a repeat-infringer admin review queue at 3+ active strikes in 12 months. This exception is acknowledged in the ToS (per counsel review of comment #1) so users understand append-only is community-scoped, not absolute.

## Pre-Launch Legal & Compliance Blockers

This section captures features that are required before public launch for legal/compliance reasons, based on outside legal counsel review of three documents: the Subscriber Agreement and Terms of Use (counsel comments dated April 20–24, 2026), the Privacy Policy (embedded in the same document), and the Website Copyright Policy (counsel comments dated April 20–24, 2026).

**Three phases follow, with different launch-blocker status:**
- **Phase 51 (click-wrap consent)** — ✅ **COMPLETE (April 25, 2026).** Hard blocker resolved.
- **Phase 52 (data export + correction + privacy contact)** — ✅ **COMPLETE (April 25, 2026).** Hard blocker resolved. (Phase 52d optional data subject request form intentionally deferred — `orcaconcepts@gmail.com` mailto in the Privacy & Data section is sufficient until volume warrants a structured form.)
- **Phase 53 (DMCA + illegal-content removal infrastructure)** — ✅ **COMPLETE (April 28, 2026).** All sub-phases shipped: 53a public intake forms, 53b admin permanent-removal endpoint + `legal_hold` flag + admin review UI + mark-notified workflow, 53c `dmca_strikes` table + repeat-infringer admin review queue. No transactional email — manual response from `orcaconcepts@gmail.com` per Architecture Decision #275. User suspension is intentionally manual via psql.

LLC formation can proceed. All three pre-launch legal/compliance phases (51, 52, 53) are complete. Orca is launch-ready from a legal-compliance standpoint: click-wrap consent, data portability/correction, Copyright Policy, DMCA agent registration, infringement/counter-notice intake forms, admin removal tooling, and repeat-infringer tracking are all in place.

### Phase 51: Click-Wrap Consent at Registration & Document Upload — ✅ COMPLETE (April 25, 2026)

**Driver:** Counsel comment #0 — "You should use a click-wrap (not a browser wrap)." Browse-wrap agreements (where mere use of the site implies acceptance) are increasingly held unenforceable by courts. Click-wrap requires an affirmative action — typically a checkbox the user must tick before proceeding.

**Implementation summary:**

- **Phase 51a** (schema + backend): Added `tos_accepted_at TIMESTAMP` and `tos_version_accepted VARCHAR(32)` columns to `users` (nullable, idempotent `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` in `migrate.js`). Backend `verifyRegister` now requires `tosAccepted: true` and `tosVersion: <string>` in the request body, rejecting with 400 otherwise. Hardcoded constant `CURRENT_TOS_VERSION = '2026-04-25'` in `backend/src/config/constants.js`. Standalone backfill script `backend/src/config/backfill-tos-consent.js` (NOT in `migrate.js` per Architecture Decision #271) sets existing rows to `tos_accepted_at = created_at` and `tos_version_accepted = 'pre-launch'`. All test users (alice, bob, etc.) successfully backfilled.
- **Phase 51b+c** (static pages + LoginModal checkbox): Created `/terms` and `/privacy` routes serving placeholder content (`TermsPage.jsx` and `PrivacyPage.jsx`) — no comment functionality, accessible to unauthenticated users. `LoginModal.jsx` Sign Up step 3 (details) merged the previous standalone "I am at least 18 years old" checkbox into a single click-wrap checkbox: *"I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I confirm I am at least 18 years old."* — with hyperlinks to `/terms` and `/privacy` opening in new tabs. Sign Up button `disabled={!tosAccepted}`. Frontend constant `CURRENT_TOS_VERSION = '2026-04-25'` in `frontend/src/config/constants.js` passed through `api.js` `verifyRegister` call.
- **Phase 51d** (document upload affirmation modal): **Verified already correct, no refactor needed.** The existing copyright affirmation modal (Phase 36) was already implemented as a checkbox + disabled-button click-wrap. Confirmed by code inspection.

**Followup note (split-phase regression window):** Between commits for Phase 51a and Phase 51b+c, registration was fully broken — the backend rejected all registrations because no UI existed yet to send `tosAccepted: true`. This is a generally applicable pattern for any feature split across backend and frontend commits; future phases should run such pairs back-to-back to minimize the broken-state window. See Architecture Decision #272 for the click-wrap pattern itself.

**Note on placeholder content (resolved Phase 56d):** The `/terms` and `/privacy` placeholder content described in Phase 51b+c has been replaced with final counsel-reviewed legal documents. `CURRENT_TOS_VERSION` was bumped from `'2026-04-25'` to `'1.0'`. New `/copyright` page added with the Copyright Policy. All three pages now fetch their HTML from `frontend/public/legal/*.html` at runtime — the legal text lives in static HTML files, not JSX, so future counsel-reviewed revisions are a one-file replacement with no source-code changes required (apart from another `CURRENT_TOS_VERSION` bump for substantive ToS changes).

### Phase 52: Data Export, Correction, and Privacy Contact — ✅ COMPLETE (April 25, 2026)

**Driver:** Counsel comment #11 — Colorado Privacy Act grants consumers the right to data portability ("personal data in a portable and easily usable format that allows transmission to another entity without hindrance") and the right to correct inaccurate personal data. Counsel confirmed the right to portability "effectively means Orca needs to implement a data export feature." A contact channel must also exist for export, correction, and deletion requests. Counsel confirmed Orca does NOT need a "Do Not Sell / Share" opt-out (no targeted advertising, no sale of personal data).

**Implementation summary:**

- **Phase 52a** (export endpoint + audit table + rate limit): New `data_export_requests` audit table (see Planned Tables section) — `(user_id, requested_at)` per export. New endpoint `GET /api/users/me/export` in `usersController.js`. Returns a single JSON file with three top-level sections: `account` (username, email, created_at, age_verified_at, tos_accepted_at, tos_version_accepted, orcid_id), `contributions` (annotations, web_links, page_comments, moderation_comments, documents_uploaded, corpuses_owned, superconcepts_owned, document_coauthorships), and `votes_and_subscriptions` (10 vote/subscription tables). NEVER includes credential fields (`password_hash`, `phone_hash`, `phone_lookup`). Uses `LEFT JOIN` for nullable FKs (Phase 36 rule). Independent queries run in `Promise.all` with `.catch()` fallbacks per query (silent-failure prevention rule). Audit row inserted AFTER successful data collection — failed exports do NOT burn the user's quota (see Architecture Decision #274). Rate limit: 2 exports per rolling 12-month period; returns 429 with `{ error, exports_used, limit }` if exceeded. Independent of the existing rate limiter infrastructure (Phase 49) — different policy purpose, different storage. Filename: `orca-export-{username}-{ISO-date}.json`. New backend constant `PRIVACY_CONTACT_EMAIL = 'orcaconcepts@gmail.com'` in `backend/src/config/constants.js`.
- **Phase 52b+c** (email correction + frontend Privacy & Data section): New endpoint `PATCH /api/users/me` accepting `{ email?: string }` — validates and normalizes (lowercase, trim) before writing to `users.email`. Returns updated user row. Unknown body keys ignored (forward-compatible). Username and ORCID intentionally NOT editable here (username locked for graph integrity; ORCID has its own connect/disconnect flow from Phase 41a). New helper endpoint `GET /api/users/me/export-status` returns `{ exports_used, limit, period }` without inserting an audit row — used by the frontend to show the counter without consuming quota. New frontend constant `PRIVACY_CONTACT_EMAIL` in `frontend/src/config/constants.js` (mirrors backend). New "Privacy & Data" section on the profile page with three subsections: (1) inline email edit affordance (read-only by default, Edit/Save/Cancel buttons, inline error display on 400); (2) data export — description text, "Download my data (JSON)" button, exports-used counter, blob-download flow with filename pulled from `Content-Disposition`, status refetched after successful download; (3) privacy contact mailto link to `orcaconcepts@gmail.com`.
- **Wording follow-up commit** (post-52b+c): Replaced user-facing strings that explicitly named the "Colorado Privacy Act" with plain language ("You can download your data up to twice per 12-month period"). The legal grounding remained accurate but was misleading on its face — the CPA *permits* but does not *require* the 2/12-months cap (see Architecture Decision #274). The CPA reference is preserved in code comments, in this status doc, and in the Privacy Policy where it legally belongs.

**Phase 52d (data subject request form)** — intentionally **deferred**. The Privacy & Data section's privacy contact mailto (`orcaconcepts@gmail.com`) is sufficient for the small volume of structured-request traffic Orca will see pre-launch and early-launch. Add a real form when volume warrants it.

**Out of scope for Phase 52 (intentional, all confirmed by counsel):**
- Right-to-be-forgotten beyond existing account deletion (already implemented in Phase 17 / Section 17 of ToS — `username` is replaced with placeholder, votes/subscriptions deleted, contributions stay).
- Document file downloads in the export bundle (metadata only for v1).
- Bulk export of graph data (different feature — public data API, post-launch roadmap).
- "Do Not Sell" opt-out (not required).
- Toll-free phone number (counsel confirmed email is sufficient as one of three permitted contact methods).

### Phase 53: DMCA & Illegal-Content Removal Infrastructure — ✅ COMPLETE (April 28, 2026)

**Driver:** Two convergent requirements from the legal review:
1. **DMCA safe harbor** (17 U.S.C. § 512, Copyright Policy review): To qualify for §512(c) safe harbor, Orca must (a) "expeditiously" remove content upon valid takedown notice (§512(c)(1)(C)), (b) notify the subscriber of removal (§512(g)(2)(A)), (c) handle counter-notifications and restore content if no court action follows in 10–14 business days (§512(g)(2)(C)), and (d) "reasonably implement" a repeat-infringer termination policy (§512(i)(1)(A)).
2. **§230 illegal-content removal** (counsel comment #1 on ToS): Although §230 gives broad immunity for user content, if Orca has *actual knowledge* that content violates the law, it must proactively remove it. The current hide mechanism (10 flags + admin override) is insufficient for this — hide is contestable, restorable, and primarily community-driven. Legally-mandated removal needs a different mechanism.

These two requirements share the same underlying need: a permanent, admin-initiated, audited removal mechanism that bypasses the community moderation system, plus public intake for receiving notices. Phase 53 builds the unified infrastructure for both.

**Launch positioning:** All Phase 53 sub-phases are now COMPLETE. Orca has the full §512 safe harbor infrastructure: public intake forms (53a), admin permanent-removal with audit trail and `legal_hold` enforcement (53b), and repeat-infringer tracking with admin review queue (53c). No transactional email — all notification is manual from `orcaconcepts@gmail.com`. User suspension is intentionally a manual psql action after admin review of the repeat-infringer queue.

**🚨 Major scope simplification (April 28, 2026):** The original Phase 53 plan included a "Phase 53.0" prerequisite to build transactional email infrastructure (provider selection — Postmark or AWS SES — plus a `sendEmail` wrapper) so that subscriber notification emails (§512(g)(2)(A)) and complainant-forwarding emails could be sent automatically. **This entire layer has been removed from scope.** Miles will manually respond to all infringement and counter-notice submissions from `orcaconcepts@gmail.com` using the contact information captured on the intake forms. The §512(g)(2)(A) "reasonable steps to promptly notify the subscriber" requirement is satisfied by manual reply within an expeditious timeframe (24–48 hours per case-law guidance). See Architecture Decision #275 for the full rationale.

**Conceptual relationship to append-only philosophy:** This is a **documented exception** to "Nothing Is Ever Deleted" (see Permanence & Moderation Rules section). Append-only governs *user-driven* deletion and the *community* moderation system. Phase 53's permanent removal is *Company-initiated*, in response to legal obligation. The exception must be acknowledged in the Permanence section of this document and (per counsel review) in the ToS as well.

**Phase 53a: Public intake forms — ✅ COMPLETE (April 28, 2026)**

Built two public, no-auth web forms for receiving copyright infringement notices and counter-notifications, with submissions stored in dedicated DB tables for manual review.

- **Schema** (added in `migrate.js`): `copyright_infringement_notices` and `copyright_counter_notices` tables. Each captures submitter name, email, free-text body containing the §512(c)(3)(A) or §512(g)(3) required statements (provided as structured prompts on the form pages), plus `created_at` timestamp.
- **Backend:** New `legalController.js` handles both submissions with field validation; new `routes/legal.js` exposes `POST /api/legal/infringement` and `POST /api/legal/counter-notice` (both no-auth — copyright holders are typically not Orca users); mounted at `/api/legal` in `server.js`.
- **Frontend:** New `InfringementNoticePage.jsx` and `CounterNoticePage.jsx` components, each rendering a form with the required §512 elements listed in the page copy + name/email/body input fields. Wired into `AppShell.jsx` via `LEGAL_SLUGS` extension, accessible at `/report-infringement` and `/counter-notice`. `LegalPage.jsx` (the `/legal` hub) gained a new "Copyright Notices" section linking to both forms. `legalAPI.submitInfringement` and `submitCounterNotice` added to `frontend/src/services/api.js`.
- **Manual review workflow:** Miles checks both tables periodically with `SELECT * FROM copyright_infringement_notices ORDER BY created_at DESC;` and the equivalent for counter-notices. He responds from `orcaconcepts@gmail.com` to the email captured in each submission.

**Open question for next legal review:** the counter-notice form is currently no-auth (anyone can submit). The original plan was to require authentication (since only the affected user is supposed to file under §512(g)(3)). Building it no-auth was reasonable for symmetry with the infringement form, and the §512(g)(3) signature + good-faith-statement requirements provide some attestation, but worth confirming this is acceptable pre-launch.

**URLs:**

| Page | URL |
|------|-----|
| Legal hub | `/legal` |
| Terms of Service | `/terms` |
| Privacy Policy | `/privacy` |
| Copyright Policy | `/copyright` |
| Report Infringement | `/report-infringement` |
| Counter-Notification | `/counter-notice` |
| Admin Legal Panel | `/admin/legal` (admin-only) |

---

**Phase 53b: Admin permanent-removal endpoint + legal_hold + admin UI — ✅ COMPLETE (April 28, 2026)**

**Implemented across sub-phases 53b-1 through 53b-4:**

- **53b-1 (schema):** `legal_removals` audit table + `legal_hold BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false` columns on `concepts`, `edges`, and `concept_links` — all added idempotently to `migrate.js`.
- **53b-2 (removal endpoint):** `POST /api/admin/legal-removal` in `adminLegalController.js`, gated by `ADMIN_USER_ID` env var. Accepts `{ target_type, target_id, removal_reason, notice_reference, internal_notes }`. Behavior by target type: hard-delete for `document_version`, `annotation`, `page_comment`, `moderation_comment`; hide + `legal_hold = true` for `concept`, `edge`, `web_link`. All operations wrapped in a DB transaction with the `legal_removals` audit insert. Response includes `affected_user_email` and `affected_username` for manual notification. `user_notified_at` starts as NULL. Existing community unhide in `moderationController.unhideEdge` rejects unhide when `legal_hold = true` (403 with contact email). Notice reference convention: DMCA removals use `copyright_infringement_notices.id=<id>` prefix (logged as warning if non-standard, not rejected).
- **53b-3 (admin UI):** `AdminLegalRemovalsPanel.jsx` at `/admin/legal` (via `LEGAL_SLUGS` in `AppShell.jsx`). Three sections: (1) Incoming Infringement Notices with inline removal form and `acted_on` detection via `legal_removals.notice_reference` EXISTS subquery, (2) Counter-Notices with manual forwarding instructions, (3) Legal Removals audit history. On successful removal, displays affected user email prominently with copy-to-clipboard and §512(g)(2)(A) notification reminder template. Admin link visible only to admin users via `isAdmin` field on `/auth/me`. Backend: `GET /api/admin/legal/notices`, `GET /api/admin/legal/counter-notices`, `GET /api/admin/legal/removals` — all admin-only.
- **53b-4 (mark-notified):** `POST /api/admin/legal/removals/:id/mark-notified` sets `user_notified_at = NOW()`. "Mark notified" button in audit history replaces itself with timestamp after click.

---

**Phase 53c: Repeat-infringer tracking — ✅ COMPLETE (April 28, 2026)**

**Implemented across sub-phases 53c-1 and 53c-2:**

- **53c-1 (schema + auto-insert):** `dmca_strikes` table with `user_id`, `legal_removal_id`, `struck_at`, `cleared_at`, `cleared_reason`. Partial index `idx_dmca_strikes_user_active ON dmca_strikes(user_id) WHERE cleared_at IS NULL`. Auto-insert: when `legalRemove` handler inserts a `legal_removals` row with `removal_reason = 'dmca'` AND `affected_user_id` is non-null, a `dmca_strikes` row is inserted in the same transaction.
- **53c-2 (admin review queue):** `GET /api/admin/legal/repeat-infringers` returns users with 3+ active (un-cleared) DMCA strikes in the trailing 12 months, with full strike details joined to `legal_removals` for context. `POST /api/admin/legal/strikes/:id/clear` dismisses a strike with a required reason. Frontend: "Repeat Infringers" section at the top of `AdminLegalRemovalsPanel.jsx` (highest-urgency item). Per-user expandable strike list with "Dismiss strike" button and reason textarea. Users drop off the queue when active strikes fall below 3. Instructional block documents manual psql suspension procedure (no suspend button or endpoint — intentional scope decision per Architecture Decision #276).

**Operational handling SOP (separate deliverable, not code):** Before launch, draft a one-page internal procedure for evaluating takedown notices: the §512(c)(3)(A) seven-element checklist, the §512(c)(3)(B)(ii) "partial compliance triggers a duty to assist" rule, the standard for "substantial compliance," and the contact-the-complainant-for-clarification template. Also document the manual user-suspension procedure: when a user appears on the repeat-infringer queue, review their strike history; if suspension is warranted, update `users.<suspension_column>` directly via psql, then send a notification email from orcaconcepts@gmail.com. This SOP lives outside the codebase.

**Out of scope for Phase 53 (intentional):**
- Automatic content fingerprinting / proactive infringement detection. §512(m)(1) explicitly says safe harbor does NOT require proactive monitoring. Building this would *increase* legal exposure (creates "actual knowledge" risk), not decrease it.
- Standard technical measures accommodation (§512(i)(1)(B)). No industry-standard measure has actually been formally adopted; this is currently a paper requirement. Boilerplate acknowledgment in the Copyright Policy is sufficient — counsel can advise on whether to add it.
- Transparency reporting (publishing aggregate takedown stats). Best practice but not legally required at Orca's scale.
- Public DMCA notice repository. Some platforms (GitHub, Lumen) publish redacted takedown notices for transparency. Worth considering long-term but out of scope for v1.

**Counsel reviews open for this phase:**
- Confirm 3-strikes-in-12-months threshold for repeat-infringer queue is "reasonable implementation" of §512(i)(1)(A).
- Confirm manual email reply (from `orcaconcepts@gmail.com`, no automated transactional email) satisfies the §512(g)(2)(A) "reasonable steps to promptly notify the subscriber" requirement, given expected pre-launch and early-launch volume.
- Confirm no-auth counter-notice intake is acceptable, or whether it should be gated to authenticated users only (see counsel question #9).
- Confirm `legal_hold` flag interaction with append-only philosophy is properly documented in the ToS amendment that follows from counsel comment #1.

### Other Counsel Comments — Status & Action

| # | Anchor | Issue | Resolution | Implementation impact |
|---|--------|-------|------------|----------------------|
| 0 | "AGREEMENT" (opening) | Browse-wrap → click-wrap | **Phase 51** | Frontend: registration checkbox; possibly upload modal |
| 1 | "or the Company" (Tier system intro) | §230 illegal-content removal vs. append-only | **Phase 53 ✅ COMPLETE** — admin-initiated permanent removal mechanism with audit trail (`legal_removals` table, `legal_hold` flag) is the documented exception to append-only philosophy. All sub-phases shipped: 53a public intake forms, 53b admin removal endpoint + UI + mark-notified, 53c `dmca_strikes` + repeat-infringer review queue. ToS amendment still needed to acknowledge this exception | Done |
| 2 | "child" concepts | Term collides with "no users under 18" | **Cosmetic doc edit** — replace "child concepts" with "descendant concepts" throughout ToS. UI uses both "child" and "descendant"; consider standardizing on "descendant" in user-facing copy too. Low priority — codebase rename can be later | Possible UI copy pass. Not a blocker |
| 3 | "owns the Submission document" | Ambiguous: IP ownership vs. platform control? | **Cosmetic doc edit** — clarify in ToS this means platform-level control (delete, assign co-authors), NOT IP ownership. IP stays with the actual copyright holder | None — doc-only |
| 4 | "any material that:" (rule list) | Counsel asks for Orca-specific additions | **Review pass** — current list covers vote manipulation, moderation circumvention, graph spam. Worth adding: bad-faith mass-flagging, attempts to evade 18+ requirement. Multi-account vote manipulation already covered | None — doc-only |
| 5 | "ownership" of Corpuses/Superconcepts | "Ownership" suggests IP rights | **Cosmetic doc edit** — replace with "stewardship" or "administration" in ToS. Consider whether to rename "owner" → "steward" in the UI as well. UI rename is non-trivial (affects CorpusDetailView, ComboTabContent, sidebar labels, member panel copy). Recommendation: rename in legal docs only for now; defer UI rename to a later phase | UI rename possible follow-up phase. Not a blocker |
| 6 | "any changes or amendments to this Agreement" | Don't promise to notify users of changes | **Doc edit only** — accept counsel's redline | None |
| 7 | "in the database" (phone storage) | Counsel asks "do you mean by the Company?" | **Cosmetic doc edit** — minor clarification | None |
| 8 | "identifiers" (third-party advertising) | Third-party data collection disclosure | **Resolved in current draft** — Twilio, ORCID, Cloudflare are disclosed in §4. Add to operational checklist: annual review of these vendors' privacy practices to maintain "reasonable awareness" per CA/DE law | New annual compliance task — see "Operational Compliance Tasks" below |
| 9 | "UI" (visibility section) | Spell out "user interface" | **Cosmetic doc edit** | None |
| 10 | "data" (security section) | Confirms industry-standard language is sufficient | **Accept counsel's redline** in subsection (e) | None |
| 11 | "exists" (data export feature) | **Build the data export feature** (Colorado) | ✅ **Phase 52 COMPLETE** | Backend + frontend, see Phase 52 above |

**Outstanding questions for counsel (next legal review pass):**
1. Comment #5: should "owner" → "steward" rename be reflected in the UI as well, or legal documents only?
2. Privacy Policy contact section currently has TWO different request limits stated — "more than twice within any 12-month period" (request-limits paragraph) and "twice within a 12-month period" (Contact section) — please harmonize to a single phrasing.
3. Confirm the chosen privacy contact email (suggested: `privacy@orcaconcepts.org`) before final ToS draft.
4. **Copyright Policy review (Phase 53 driver):** Confirm Orca qualifies as a §512(k)(1)(B) "service provider" — yes per our reading, but please confirm.
5. **DMCA agent registration address:** the current draft uses the maintainer's home address. Options to avoid posting a residential address in the public Copyright Office directory: (a) use the law firm's office address with permission, (b) retain a registered-agent service for ~$100–200/year, (c) apply for the §201.38(b) P.O. box waiver. Which is lowest-friction? This decision affects both the Copyright Office filing AND the contact information posted on the website's `/copyright` page — both permanent, both indexable.
6. **Standard technical measures (§512(i)(1)(B)):** worth a one-line acknowledgment in the Copyright Policy or ToS, or is omitting it acceptable given no industry standard has been formally adopted?
7. **Repeat-infringer policy threshold:** Phase 53 contemplates 3 valid DMCA notices in a trailing 12 months as the trigger for admin review (not automatic suspension). Does this satisfy "reasonable implementation" under §512(i)(1)(A) and the *BMG v. Cox* line of cases?
8. **Subscriber notification language (manual reply):** Phase 53 will use manual email replies from `orcaconcepts@gmail.com` rather than automated transactional email (Architecture Decision #275). Confirm template wording for DMCA / illegal-content / court-order removal replies accurately describes legal basis without admitting liability or making representations about the underlying claim. Templates will be maintained as snippets/SOP outside the codebase.
9. **Counter-notice form authentication:** Phase 53a built `POST /api/legal/counter-notice` as a no-auth public endpoint (symmetric with the infringement-notice form). Confirm that no-auth counter-notice intake satisfies §512(g)(3) requirements — the form does collect signature + good-faith statement + consent-to-jurisdiction. Alternative would be requiring login so the counter-noticer's identity is tied to the affected user account.
10. **ToS amendment for legal-removal exception:** confirm append-only philosophy carve-out for Company-initiated legal removal (Phase 53) is properly documented in the next ToS revision so users have notice that legally-removed content is non-restorable through community moderation.

### Operational Compliance Tasks (Recurring)

These are not coding tasks but should be tracked alongside the code roadmap so they don't fall through the cracks:

- **Annual third-party vendor review** (driven by counsel comment #8): Once per year, re-read the privacy policies of Twilio, ORCID, and Cloudflare, plus any new vendors added (Railway, etc.). Confirm they still match what Orca's Privacy Policy describes. Update Privacy Policy if vendor practices have materially changed. CA and DE laws expect this "reasonable awareness." Suggested: add to a shared calendar with annual recurrence.
- **DMCA agent registration** (already on roadmap): Register Orca as an interactive computer service with the U.S. Copyright Office DMCA agent directory after LLC formation completes. Use LLC name in registration. DMCA/platform law support to be retained separately. Filing fee was $6 base + $1/additional address as of last check — verify current fee on the Copyright Office site before filing.
- **DMCA agent re-registration (every 3 years):** Per 37 CFR §201.38, designated agent registrations must be renewed every 3 years or they lapse. A lapsed registration breaks §512 safe harbor. Calendar reminder set for 30 days before the 3-year anniversary of the initial filing date. Update on every re-registration: confirm the listed address, name, and URLs are still accurate.
- **Privacy contact monitoring**: Once `privacy@orcaconcepts.org` is provisioned, set up monitoring (forward to the maintainer's email or similar) so requests don't go unanswered. Colorado, GDPR, and others impose response timeframes (typically 30–45 days).
- **DMCA contact monitoring** (Phase 53 dependency): Once the DMCA agent email is provisioned (separate from `privacy@`, suggested: `dmca@orcaconcepts.org` or whatever is registered with the Copyright Office), set up monitoring with the same urgency as `privacy@`. The "expeditious removal" standard in §512(c)(1)(C) is interpreted as 24–48 hours by case law; an unmonitored inbox is a safe-harbor risk.
- **Operational handling SOP for takedown notices** (Phase 53 dependency): Maintain a one-page internal procedure outside the codebase covering: §512(c)(3)(A) seven-element checklist, the §512(c)(3)(B)(ii) "partial compliance triggers a duty to assist" rule, the standard for "substantial compliance," and the contact-the-complainant-for-clarification template. Review annually.

## My Notes on Status

Phase 1: Complete.
Phase 2: Complete. All features implemented — Display totals, root concept voting, browser back button integration, Flip View (flat vote-sorted cards), and Combined Add/Search field with pg_trgm fuzzy matching.
Phase 3: Complete. Attribute system implemented — attributes table with action/tool/value, attribute_id on edges, two-step creation flow (name → attribute picker), attributes displayed in square brackets everywhere, 40-character name validation (later raised to 255 in Phase 28g), existing edges migrated to [action].
Phase 4: Complete. Full-path save model, cascading unsave, Sort by New, Link votes, Flip View similarity percentage, Move votes, Swap votes, Vote Set Visualization (Layer 1: swatches + dots + basic filtering), Vote Set Tiered Display (Layer 2: toggle for ranked sections), and Vote Set Similarity Grouping (Layer 3: super-groups with hierarchical clustering) all implemented.
Phase 5a: Complete. Basic Saved Page with tree display, unsave with cascading, collapse/expand, move/swap vote indicators, and navigation to concept-in-context. "Saved" button added to Root and Concept page headers.
Phase 5b: Complete. Saved Tabs with `saved_tabs` and `vote_tab_links` junction table, default tab auto-created on registration, migration backfill for existing users/votes, tab bar UI on Saved Page (switch/create/rename/delete), inline tab picker dropdown on ▲ save button, per-tab save filtering, tab-scoped unsave with orphan cleanup.
Phase 5c-1: Complete. Unified tab bar shell (AppShell) with persistent graph tabs. New `graph_tabs` database table. Backend CRUD for graph tabs (get/create/update/close). AppShell.jsx wraps entire app — one header, unified tab bar showing saved tabs (italic, left side) + graph tabs (right side) with `+` button. Saved tabs no longer have ✕ button — only removable via right-click context menu ("Remove tab and unsave concepts"). Graph tabs have ✕ to close. Right-click context menu supports Duplicate (graph tabs) and Open in New Window. Root.jsx and Concept.jsx refactored to accept props for tab mode (graphTabId, onNavigate, initialConceptId, etc.) — no more their own headers. New SavedTabContent.jsx extracted from Saved.jsx renders inside saved tabs. Clicking a concept in a saved tree opens a new graph tab. App.jsx simplified to login/register + AppShell for all authenticated routes. `/saved` route retired.
Phase 5c-2: Complete. Within-tab navigation with in-tab back button. `navHistory` stack in Concept.jsx tracks forward navigation; `←` back button appears in concept header bar when history is non-empty. All graph tabs rendered simultaneously with `display: none` on inactive ones (hide-not-unmount) so nav history survives tab switching. `handleGraphTabNavigate` in AppShell normalizes camelCase update keys (tabType, conceptId, viewMode) to snake_case (tab_type, concept_id, view_mode) before applying to local state, and applies state optimistically before the DB call. Tab label updates after concept loads via a `useEffect` on `concept` + `currentAttribute`.
Phase 5c-3: Complete. Search results navigate the current graph tab to the decontextualized flip view (rather than URL routing). SearchField accepts `graphTabId` + `onNavigate` props; when in tab mode, clicking a result calls `onNavigate` instead of `navigate()`. Root and Concept pass these props down to SearchField. Concept detects when it was opened directly into flip view from root (initialViewMode === 'flip' and no path) and pre-seeds `navHistory` with a root entry so the back button works immediately. `navigateBack` sends `label: 'Root'` when popping back to root so the tab label updates correctly.
Phase 5c-4: Complete. Polish and edge cases for graph tab management. Adjacent-tab switching on close (Chrome-style: prefer tab to the right, fall back to left). Auto-create a fresh Root graph tab when the last graph tab is closed (prevents user from being stuck with no graph tabs). Context menu overflow protection (clamped to viewport). Removed broken "Open in new window" for saved tabs (no standalone route exists); saved tab context menu now shows only "Remove tab and unsave concepts" (when 2+ tabs) or "No actions available" (last tab). Fixed stale-state bug where closing the last graph tab created two Root tabs instead of one (`setGraphTabs([newTab])` instead of appending to stale `prev`).
Phase 5d: Complete. Tab Grouping with named expandable groups. New `tab_groups` table + `group_id` nullable FK on `saved_tabs` and `graph_tabs`. 7 backend endpoints (get/create/rename/delete/toggle/add-tab/remove-tab). Groups render in tab bar between saved tabs and graph tabs — each group is a clickable expand/collapse header showing ▸/▾ arrow, name, and member count. Expanded groups show member tabs inline with left border. Context menus updated: right-click ungrouped tab → create/add to group; right-click grouped tab → remove from group; right-click group header → rename/delete. Double-click group header to rename inline. Expand/collapse state persisted to DB with optimistic update. Deleting a group ungroups tabs (sets group_id = NULL), does not delete them.
Phase 5e: Complete. Saved Tree Reordering with persistent order. New `saved_tree_order` table with `(user_id, saved_tab_id, root_concept_id)` unique constraint. 2 backend endpoints (`GET /tree-order`, `POST /tree-order/update`). SavedTabContent.jsx updated with ▲/▼ arrow buttons on each root tree card. Optimistic state updates with DB persistence. Trees with explicit order sort first by `display_order`; unordered trees fall to bottom by save count.
Phase 5f: Complete. Child Ordering Within Vote Sets. New `child_rankings` table with 3 backend endpoints (get/update/remove). Only the user's own vote set can be ranked (backend validates); other sets show aggregated rankings read-only. `getVoteSets` response now includes `userSetIndex`, `parentEdgeId`, and `voteSetKey` per set. Solo vote sets enabled (removed 2+ user threshold from `HAVING` clause). User's own swatch has bold dark border + "Your vote set" tooltip. Dropdown selector (1 to N) on each child card when viewing own set. Aggregated rank badges on all single-set views. Rank-based sorting (most popular rank wins, then user count, then saves). Ranking cleanup on unsave in both `removeVote` and `removeVoteFromTab`.
Phase 5 misc: Complete. Three sub-features implemented:
- **Read-Only Guest Access:** Non-logged-in users can browse graphs, search, navigate, and see save counts and vote sets — all read-only. New `optionalAuth` middleware in `auth.js` passes `req.user = null` for guests; concept GET routes switched from `authenticateToken` to `optionalAuth`; all `req.user.userId` references in `conceptsController.js` made null-safe (pass `-1` for guests so `user_voted`/`user_linked` = false, `userSetIndex` = null). Frontend: `App.jsx` removes `ProtectedRoute` wrapper; `AppShell.jsx` shows "Log in / Sign up" header for guests, creates ephemeral local-only graph tabs (no DB persistence), hides saved tabs and groups; `Root.jsx`, `Concept.jsx`, `ConceptGrid.jsx`, `FlipView.jsx`, `SearchField.jsx` all accept `isGuest` prop — vote/save/move/swap/link buttons hidden or read-only for guests, "Add as child" and "Create as root" hidden. `AuthContext.jsx` exports `isGuest` boolean.
- **Search Surfacing Saved Tabs:** When a logged-in user searches, the backend cross-references search results against the user's saved edges via `votes` → `vote_tab_links` → `saved_tabs` → `edges`. Results appearing in saved tabs get a `savedTabs` array (with `tabId` and `tabName`). These results are sorted to the top. `SearchField.jsx` displays an "In your saved tabs" section header and green italic tab-name badges on matching results. Backend also now returns `exactMatch` boolean (was previously missing).
- **Ctrl+F Verification:** Verified browser-native Ctrl+F works on Root page, Concept page (children view), Flip View, and Saved tabs. No issues found — all rendered text is findable.
- **FlipView Navigation Fix (pre-existing bug from Phase 5c):** Clicking an alt parent card in Flip View was using URL-based `navigate()` which stopped working when everything moved to AppShell tab mode in Phase 5c. Fix: `Concept.jsx` now passes `onParentClick` callback to `FlipView.jsx` which calls `navigateInTab()` for proper in-tab navigation with nav history support. Falls back to URL navigation in standalone mode.
- **SearchField childAttributes Display Fix (pre-existing bug):** The `childAttributes` array from the backend contains raw strings (e.g., `"action"`) but `SearchField.jsx` was treating them as objects with `.attribute_name`, producing `child:undefined` badges. Fixed to handle both string and object formats.
Note: Multiple browser tabs. Users can open Orca in multiple browser tabs while staying logged in. Each browser tab has its own independent React state, so navigating in one does not affect the other. No shared-state mechanisms (localStorage broadcasts, BroadcastChannel, etc.) exist between tabs. This should work naturally — verify during testing.
Phase 6: Complete. All four sub-phases implemented:
- **Phase 6a:** Web Links Backend — `concept_links` and `concept_link_votes` database tables, 5 backend endpoints (getWebLinks, addWebLink, removeWebLink, upvoteWebLink, removeWebLinkVote) with optionalAuth on GET for guest access, frontend API methods.
- **Phase 6b:** External Links Page UI — `WebLinksView.jsx` component with upvote buttons, sort toggle, add form with URL validation, guest read-only mode. Accessible via 🔗 Links button in concept header bar (next to Flip View toggle). View mode `'links'` with proper nav history.
- **Phase 6c:** Flip View Cross-Context Links Compilation — `FlipLinksView.jsx` component showing all web links across ALL parent contexts grouped by parent edge. New backend endpoint `getAllWebLinksForConcept`. Current context highlighted and interactive; other contexts read-only. Accessible via 🔗 All Links button in Flip View header. View mode `'fliplinks'` with proper nav history.
- **Phase 6d:** Shareable Concept Links — 📋 Share button in concept header bar copies URL to clipboard with brief "✓ Copied!" feedback. Uses `navigator.clipboard.writeText` with legacy fallback. Frontend-only change.

- **Phase 48:** ❌ REVERTED (edge discussions feature; fully implemented then fully reverted via `git reset --hard` + force-push + manual `DROP TABLE edge_discussions` and `edge_discussion_votes`. Phase number 48 reused below for a different scope but currently held open — see "On the Horizon" notes about persistent annotation highlight + AND/OR superconcept match mode that were prompted under reused Phase 48.)
- **Phase 49:** Rate Limiting Hardening — ✅ 49a/49b/49d COMPLETE (49a: trust proxy + SMS abuse protection with Postgres-backed pgRateLimitStore; 49b: write-endpoint user-keyed limiters via perUserHourly factory + initial global safety net; 49d: global safety net raised to 2000/15min, GET-exempt, Postgres-backed after lockout incident.

- **Phase 50:** Reverse Citations — "Cited by N" on Annotations — ✅ COMPLETE (50a: `GET /api/annotations/:id/cited-by` backend with cited_by_count on annotation payload; 50b: frontend "Cited by N" badge with lazy-loaded expand-to-list and click-through navigation, 409 short-circuit fix, useEffect lazy-fetch fix)
- **Phase 51:** Click-Wrap Consent at Registration & Document Upload — ✅ COMPLETE (PRE-LAUNCH BLOCKER RESOLVED — driven by counsel comment #0; 51a schema additions `tos_accepted_at` + `tos_version_accepted` on users + backend `verifyRegister` consent fields + standalone backfill script; 51b+c static `/terms` + `/privacy` placeholder pages + `LoginModal.jsx` Sign Up checkbox merging ToS/Privacy/age affirmation into one click-wrap with disabled-until-checked button; 51d document upload affirmation verified already correct — no refactor needed. See "Pre-Launch Legal & Compliance Blockers" section above for implementation summary)
- **Phase 52:** Data Export, Correction, and Privacy Contact — ✅ COMPLETE (PRE-LAUNCH BLOCKER RESOLVED — driven by counsel comment #11; 52a `GET /api/users/me/export` returning full account + contributions + votes/subscriptions JSON, `data_export_requests` audit table, 2-per-12-months rate limit returning 429 when exceeded, audit row inserted only on successful export so failures don't burn quota; 52b `PATCH /api/users/me` for email correction + `GET /api/users/me/export-status` helper for the frontend counter; 52c frontend Privacy & Data section on profile page with download button + counter + inline email edit + privacy contact mailto; 52d data subject request form intentionally **deferred** — `orcaconcepts@gmail.com` mailto is sufficient. Wording follow-up commit replaced "Colorado Privacy Act" UI strings with plain language. New `PRIVACY_CONTACT_EMAIL` constant in both backend and frontend `config/constants.js`. See "Pre-Launch Legal & Compliance Blockers" section above for implementation summary)
- **Phase 53:** DMCA & Illegal-Content Removal Infrastructure — ✅ COMPLETE (all sub-phases shipped April 28, 2026 — driven by Copyright Policy review and counsel comment #1 on the ToS; unifies §512 DMCA safe-harbor operational machinery with §230 illegal-content removal mechanism; **53a:** `copyright_infringement_notices` + `copyright_counter_notices` tables, public no-auth intake forms at `/report-infringement` and `/counter-notice`; **53b:** `legal_removals` audit table + `legal_hold` flag on concepts/edges/concept_links + admin `POST /api/admin/legal-removal` endpoint (per-target-type: hard-delete or hide+legal_hold) + `AdminLegalRemovalsPanel.jsx` admin UI at `/admin/legal` with infringement notice queue, counter-notice display, inline removal form, mark-notified workflow, audit history + `isAdmin` on `/auth/me` + `legal_hold` enforcement on community unhide; **53c:** `dmca_strikes` table with auto-insert on DMCA removal + repeat-infringer admin review queue (3+ active strikes / 12 months) with per-strike dismissal; **SCOPE DECISIONS:** transactional email removed from scope — manual response from `orcaconcepts@gmail.com` per AD #275; user suspension intentionally manual via psql per AD #276 — no suspend button or endpoint)
- **Phase 56e:** UI Polish — Filter Reorder + Brand-Voice Lowercase "orca" — ✅ COMPLETE (May 1, 2026) (two unrelated display-only changes bundled in one phase. **(a)** Reordered attribute filter buttons on the root page (and any other filter UI surfaces) from `All, Action, Tool, Value, Question` to `All, Value, Action, Tool, Question`. Display-only — no backend changes, no `ENABLED_ATTRIBUTES` env var change, no API response order change. **(b)** Renamed visible "Using Orca" label to "Using orca" (lowercase 'o') in the nav link AND the page heading. URL slug `/using-orca` unchanged (already lowercase-hyphenated by convention); `PAGE_TITLES` object key in `InfoPage.jsx` also unchanged. Lowercase 'orca' styling matches the brand-voice usage in The Storm essay (where "orca" appears in lowercase as a deliberate stylistic choice in paragraphs 4 and 5). This establishes a soft pattern: "Orca" capitalized is the default brand form, "orca" lowercase is acceptable in thematic/poetic/brand-voice contexts. Browser tab title is set globally elsewhere and was not affected. **Also shipped this session (no separate phase):** the final essay text on `/the-storm` was added via direct edit of `TheStormPage.jsx` — five paragraphs replacing the Phase 56a placeholder, with `<strong>orca</strong>` markup on the leading word of paragraph 4. Direct edits like this are appropriate for prose-only changes and don't need Claude Code prompts.)
- **Phase 56d:** Final Legal Documents Installed (ToS, Privacy Policy, Copyright Policy) — ✅ COMPLETE (May 1, 2026) (counsel-reviewed legal documents replace the Phase 51 placeholders. Static HTML files copied byte-exact into `frontend/public/legal/{terms-of-service,privacy-policy,copyright-policy}.html`. Page components `TermsPage.jsx`, `PrivacyPage.jsx`, and new `CopyrightPage.jsx` fetch the HTML at runtime and render via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` — legal text lives ONLY in `frontend/public/legal/`, never in `frontend/src/`, so future counsel-reviewed revisions are a one-file replacement with no JSX surgery. New route `/copyright` wired in `App.jsx`. `LegalPage.jsx` Copyright Policy link updated from placeholder URL `/copyright-policy` to `/copyright`. `CURRENT_TOS_VERSION` bumped from `'2026-04-25'` to `'1.0'` in both `backend/src/config/constants.js` and `frontend/src/config/constants.js` to mark the first real public version. Documents converted from .docx to clean HTML via pandoc, with structural cleanup (unwrapping pandoc's `<li><blockquote>` artifacts) verified to preserve text byte-for-byte against source DOCX files. MD5-hash verification confirms files in `frontend/public/legal/` match source files exactly.)
- **Phase 56c:** YouTube Link-Out Cards on Using Orca Page — ✅ COMPLETE (May 1, 2026) (replaced Phase 56b placeholder boxes with thumbnail card link-outs to YouTube. Each card is a clickable `<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">` with the YouTube thumbnail as background image (`https://img.youtube.com/vi/<VIDEO_ID>/maxresdefault.jpg`) and a centered play-triangle overlay (pure CSS borders, no SVG, no image asset; `pointerEvents: 'none'` so clicks pass through). Reasoning: YouTube iframe embeds use a lower bitrate ladder than youtube.com proper, so videos look noticeably fuzzier inline than on YouTube directly. Linking out gives users full-quality playback. Each card has a placeholder caption underneath that Miles will revise via direct `InfoPage.jsx` edit (no Claude Code prompt needed for prose-only changes). Two videos: `lkjSEi64DFs` and `o9JuDZjSiGw`.)
- **Phase 56b:** Using Orca Page Content Reorganization — ✅ COMPLETE (May 1, 2026) (reordered the Using Orca page sections in `InfoPage.jsx`: intro paragraph → open source paragraph → YouTube video 1 placeholder → YouTube video 2 placeholder → screenshot carousels → three use cases. Previous order was intro → use cases → open source → carousels. Video placeholders were bordered boxes with `aspectRatio: '16/9'` later swapped for thumbnail cards in 56c.)
- **Phase 56a:** Page Navigation Restructuring — ✅ COMPLETE (May 1, 2026) (removed Constitution and Donate informational pages — frontend routes, nav links, `InfoPage.jsx` PAGE_TITLES entries, and ConstitutionContent component all removed; backend `pagesController.js` `VALID_SLUGS` reduced to `['using-orca']`; one-time DELETE in `migrate.js` removed 2 stale `page_comments` rows for `constitution`/`donate` slugs (idempotent — DELETE on missing rows is a no-op). Added new static `TheStormPage.jsx` at `/the-storm` modeled on TermsPage/PrivacyPage with no comment system. Renamed "Legal" nav link to "Legal/Copyright Info". Final nav order: The Storm → Using Orca → Legal/Copyright Info. The hard-delete of pre-launch comment rows is NOT a violation of append-only philosophy — append-only governs user-generated graph content (concepts/edges/annotations/votes), not platform infrastructure decisions on test data from never-publicly-visible pages.)
- **Phase 55d:** Fix ORCID OAuth callback back-button trap — ✅ COMPLETE (two fixes: ProfilePage uses `window.location.replace()` instead of `.href` so the profile page isn't pushed to history before the ORCID redirect; OrcidCallback detects back-button loops via `user.orcidId` already-set check and calls `window.history.back()` to navigate past the ORCID authorize entry. Also added `exchangedRef` guard to prevent double code exchange from `refreshUser()`-triggered effect re-run. Discovered during production smoke test on orcaconcepts.org after DNS cutover.)
- **Phase 55b:** Seed `question` Attribute in migrate.js — ✅ COMPLETE (attributes seed was missing `question` — only action/tool/value were seeded; fresh production deploys had no question attribute in the DB, causing the root page filter to omit it. Audit of all other migrate.js seeds found no additional drift.)
- **Phase 55a:** Database Config — Use `DATABASE_URL` Connection String — ✅ COMPLETE (`database.js` uses `DATABASE_URL` with SSL when set by managed Postgres providers like Railway, falls back to individual `DB_*` env vars for local dev; `migrate.js` and all controllers inherit via shared pool import; local-only seed scripts left unchanged)
- **Phase 54:** Production Deployment Readiness — ✅ COMPLETE (54a SKIPPED — no file storage to migrate, documents store extracted text in `documents.body` via `multer.memoryStorage()` + `pdf-parse`/`mammoth` text extraction, no files on disk; 54b backend serves frontend static files in production via `express.static(frontend/dist)` + SPA fallback regex, new root `package.json` with `build` script (installs both + builds frontend) and `start` script (runs `migrate.js` then `server.js` — migrations on every deploy, safe because idempotent), frontend API already uses relative `/api` base URL with Vite proxy in dev; 54c license `AGPL-3.0-only` set in all three `package.json` files, production config audit confirmed localhost refs are dev fallbacks, no cookies/sessions, trust proxy at 2)

### Phase 37: Pre-Launch Bug Fixes — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Fix all bugs identified in the March 2026 QA pass that affect core functionality, user experience, or data integrity before public launch. Organized into six batches (37a–37f) grouped by file-touch area for efficient Claude Code sessions.

**Completed:** All six batches implemented, tested (Level 1 after each batch), and committed.

---

#### Phase 37a: Backend Controller Fixes — ✅ COMPLETE

Five backend bugs across `conceptsController.js`, `votesController.js`, and `corpusController.js`.

**Bug 1 — Logged-out users can't see swap votes:**
- **Symptom:** Guest users see no swap vote counts on concept children.
- **Root cause hypothesis:** The swap count subquery in `getConceptWithChildren` may be missing from the `optionalAuth` code path, or the query may filter by authenticated user ID in a way that returns 0 for guests.
- **Fix:** Ensure the `swap_count` subquery (via `replace_votes`) runs identically for authenticated and guest users. The swap count is a public aggregate — no user-specific filtering needed.
- **Files:** `conceptsController.js`

**Bug 2 — Can't add root concept if name exists anywhere in database:**
- **Symptom:** Creating a root concept is rejected if the concept name already exists as a non-root concept anywhere, instead of only checking for existing root edges with that name.
- **Root cause hypothesis:** The backend's duplicate check in `createRootConcept` looks at the `concepts` table globally (checking if the name exists at all) instead of checking specifically for existing root edges with that concept ID and selected attribute.
- **Fix:** The check should allow reuse of existing concept names as roots. The constraint should be: "does a root edge already exist for this concept ID with this attribute?" — not "does this concept name exist anywhere." This matches how child concept creation works (reuses existing concept rows).
- **Files:** `conceptsController.js`

**Bug 3 — Corpus members can add document versions (should be authors only):**
- **Symptom:** Users who are corpus allowed members (but not document authors/coauthors) can upload new versions of a document. Only the original uploader and coauthors should be able to.
- **Root cause hypothesis:** The `createVersion` endpoint checks corpus membership (`corpus_allowed_users`) instead of (or in addition to) author status (`documents.uploaded_by` + `document_authors`).
- **Fix:** Change the permission check in `createVersion` to verify the requesting user is a document author (uploader or coauthor via root document lookup), not just a corpus member.
- **Files:** `corpusController.js`

**Bug 4 — Web links show across all contexts instead of being edge-specific:**
- **Symptom:** A web link added to one parent context for a concept appears in all contexts for that concept. Web links should be edge-specific (tied to a specific parent context), only compiling across contexts in the Web Links tab's cross-context view.
- **Root cause hypothesis:** The query fetching web links for the current context may be using `child_id` (concept-level) instead of the specific `edge_id` for the current context.
- **Fix:** Ensure the Annotations tab's web links query filters by the current `edge_id`, not by `child_id`. The Web Links tab (cross-context compilation) can continue using `child_id` — that's its purpose.
- **Files:** `votesController.js`, `ConceptAnnotationPanel.jsx`
- **Related architecture decision:** #58 ("Web Links Are Context-Specific (Edge-Tied)")

**Bug 5 — Web link creator cannot remove their own link:**
- **Symptom:** The delete/remove button for a web link doesn't work or doesn't appear for the user who added it.
- **Root cause hypothesis:** Frontend permission check may be comparing user IDs incorrectly (e.g., `user.userId` vs `user.id` — the known frontend auth context pattern from Architecture Decision #100), or the backend `removeWebLink` endpoint may have a validation issue.
- **Fix:** Verify the frontend `added_by` comparison uses `user.id` (not `user.userId`), and verify the backend `removeWebLink` endpoint correctly checks `added_by = req.user.userId`.
- **Files:** `votesController.js`, `ConceptAnnotationPanel.jsx`

**Suggested git commit:** `fix: 37a — swap votes guest view, root concept creation, version permissions, web links context, web link deletion`

---

#### Phase 37b: Auth & Registration — ✅ COMPLETE

One bug in the phone number registration flow.

**Bug — Phone "already exists" error shows too late:**
- **Symptom:** During registration, the user can send the OTP code before being told the phone number is already registered. The check should happen as soon as the phone number is entered, before the code is sent.
- **Root cause hypothesis:** The phone uniqueness check currently lives in `verifyRegister` (after code verification), not in `sendCode` (before sending the OTP).
- **Fix:** Add a phone uniqueness check to the `sendCode` endpoint. When `intent=register` (or a new parameter indicating registration), look up the phone number via `phone_lookup` (HMAC-SHA256). If a user already exists with that `phone_lookup`, return an error immediately — before calling Twilio. The frontend should display this error on the phone number input step. For `intent=login`, the existing flow is fine (user must exist).
- **Implementation detail:** The `sendCode` endpoint currently doesn't distinguish between login and register intents. Add an optional `intent` query parameter or body field (`'login'` or `'register'`). For `register` intent, check uniqueness first. For `login` intent, optionally check that the user exists (nice-to-have: "no account with this phone number" error before sending code).
- **Files:** `authController.js`, `routes/auth.js`, `LoginModal.jsx`, `AuthContext.jsx`, `api.js`

**Suggested git commit:** `fix: 37b — check phone uniqueness before sending OTP code during registration`

---

#### Phase 37c: Corpus & Document Frontend UX — ✅ COMPLETE

Five bugs in the corpus/document upload and annotation area.

**Bug 1 — Guest error opening documents from graphs:**
- **Symptom:** Logged-out users clicking a document link from `ConceptAnnotationPanel` get a JavaScript error or failed API call instead of the login modal.
- **Fix:** Catch 401 errors from document-related API calls in the annotation panel and trigger the login modal (via `AppShell`'s `showLoginModal` state or the existing login modal pattern). The login modal should appear with a message like "Log in to view documents."
- **Files:** `ConceptAnnotationPanel.jsx`, `AppShell.jsx`

**Bug 2 — Silent failure for docs over 10MB:**
- **Symptom:** When a file exceeds 10MB, the upload fails silently — no error message shown to the user.
- **Root cause hypothesis:** The multer `LIMIT_FILE_SIZE` error middleware may not be surfacing the error response to the frontend, or the frontend's error handler doesn't display the 413 response.
- **Fix:** Verify the backend error middleware catches `MulterError` with code `LIMIT_FILE_SIZE` and returns a clear 413 JSON response. Verify the frontend upload handlers (`doFileUpload`, `doVersionUpload`) display `err.response?.data?.error` for 413 responses. Consider also adding a client-side file size check before upload for instant feedback.
- **Files:** `corpusController.js` (error middleware), `CorpusUploadForm.jsx` or `CorpusTabContent.jsx`

**Bug 3 — Tag search opens in both My Docs and All Docs:**
- **Symptom:** After clicking "Add tag," the search bar opens in both the My Documents and All Documents sections simultaneously, and typing appears in both. Only one search bar should be active.
- **Root cause hypothesis:** The tag search state is shared or duplicated between the two document list sections, likely because both sections reference the same state variable or the tag UI is rendered in both places.
- **Fix:** Ensure the tag search UI is scoped to the specific document being tagged. The search bar should only appear in the section where the user clicked "Add tag," not in both sections.
- **Files:** `CorpusTabContent.jsx` or `CorpusDocumentList.jsx`

**Bug 4 — Can't remove cancelled upload from tray:**
- **Symptom:** If the user cancels a document upload mid-process, the file remains in the upload UI tray. The only way to clear it is to refresh the page.
- **Fix:** Reset all upload-related state (`uploadFile`, `uploadDragOver`, `uploadFileError`, etc.) when the user cancels an upload. The cancel action should return the upload UI to its initial empty state.
- **Files:** `CorpusUploadForm.jsx` or `CorpusTabContent.jsx`

**Bug 5 — Duplicate document similarity percentage missing:**
- **Symptom:** The similarity percentage that used to appear during upload (warning about potential duplicate documents) is no longer showing. This feature existed before Phase 22a (file upload rewrite) and was likely lost during the rewrite.
- **Root cause hypothesis:** The `checkDuplicates` endpoint still exists in `corpusController.js`, but the frontend upload flow no longer calls it after the Phase 22a rewrite removed the old `handleCheckAndUpload` function.
- **Fix:** Reconnect the duplicate check to the file upload flow. After file selection (but before upload), call the `checkDuplicates` endpoint with the extracted text. If matches are found, display the similarity percentage and document title(s) as a warning, with an option to proceed or cancel. The backend `checkDuplicates` uses `pg_trgm similarity()` on the first 5,000 characters with a 0.3 threshold (Architecture Decision #69).
- **Files:** `corpusController.js` (verify endpoint still works), `CorpusUploadForm.jsx` or `CorpusTabContent.jsx`

**Suggested git commit:** `fix: 37c — guest document access, upload size error, tag search scope, cancelled upload reset, duplicate check reconnect`

---

#### Phase 37d: Quick Text & Style Fixes — ✅ COMPLETE

Five small fixes across several files. All are cosmetic/text changes.

**Fix 1 — Long concept names squish sorting toggles:**
- **Symptom:** In the concept view, very long concept names push the sort toggles (Graph Votes | Newest | Annotations | Top Annotation) off-screen or make them invisible.
- **Fix:** Add `overflow: hidden`, `textOverflow: 'ellipsis'`, `whiteSpace: 'nowrap'` to the concept name container, or use `flexShrink: 0` on the sort toggle row to prevent it from being compressed. The sort toggles should always be visible.
- **Files:** `Concept.jsx`

**Fix 2 — Swap vote shading doesn't match save vote shading:**
- **Symptom:** When a user votes for a swap, the visual indicator on the swap button or card is not shaded/styled the same way that save votes are (dark filled background).
- **Fix:** Apply the same active/voted styling pattern used for save votes (▲ dark filled background) to swap vote indicators. Check both `ConceptGrid.jsx` (⇄ button on child cards) and `SwapModal.jsx` (vote buttons in the modal).
- **Files:** `SwapModal.jsx`, `ConceptGrid.jsx`
- **Status:** Partially complete in Phase 37d. `SwapModal.jsx` vote buttons fixed. `ConceptGrid.jsx` ⇄ per-user active styling completed in Phase 38b/38c — backend now returns `user_swapped` field and `swapButtonActive` style is applied.

**Fix 3 — Unicode escape 'u/2026' in diff modal search bar:**
- **Symptom:** The compare children diff view shows `u/2026` (a Unicode escape for the ellipsis character `…`) after the placeholder text in the search bar.
- **Fix:** Replace the escaped Unicode with a literal ellipsis character `…` in the placeholder string, or remove it entirely.
- **Files:** `DiffModal.jsx`

**Fix 4 — Search results show redundant "child: value" label:**
- **Symptom:** In search results, concepts that are already children of the current concept show "child: value" as a badge. Since all graphs are single-attribute (Phase 20a), the attribute name is redundant. Should just say "child."
- **Fix:** Change the badge text from `child: ${attributeName}` to just `child` in the search result rendering.
- **Files:** `SearchField.jsx`

**Fix 5 — Unsubscribe warning says "removes the corpus tab" (too vague):**
- **Symptom:** The unsubscribe confirmation dialog says "removes the corpus tab" which sounds like it might delete the corpus or its data. Should clarify it only removes the tab from the user's sidebar.
- **Fix:** Change the warning text to "removes the corpus tab from your sidebar" or similar clarification.
- **Files:** `CorpusTabContent.jsx` or `CorpusDetailView.jsx` (wherever the unsubscribe confirmation lives)

**Suggested git commit:** `fix: 37d — long name layout, swap vote shading, diff modal unicode, search label, unsubscribe text`

---

#### Phase 37e: Root Page & Tab Groups — ✅ COMPLETE

Two bugs related to root-level concept operations and tab group management.

**Bug 1 — Hiding a concept on the root page doesn't work:**
- **Symptom:** Flagging a root-level concept to trigger hiding (10+ flags → `is_hidden = true`) does not work. The concept remains visible on the root page after exceeding the flag threshold.
- **Root cause hypothesis:** Root edges have `parent_id = NULL` and `graph_path = '{}'`. The flagging system in `moderationController.js` may not correctly identify or process root edges. The `getRootConcepts` query's `is_hidden` filter may also not apply to root edges correctly.
- **Fix:** Trace the flag → hide pipeline for root edges specifically. Ensure: (1) the `flagEdge` endpoint can accept root edge IDs, (2) the `is_hidden` update works on root edges, (3) the `getRootConcepts` query filters `WHERE e.is_hidden = false` on the root edge join. If root edges are excluded from flagging entirely, that's the core issue.
- **Files:** `moderationController.js`, `conceptsController.js` (`getRootConcepts`), `Root.jsx`

**Bug 2 — Deleting a tab group gives internal server error:**
- **Symptom:** Server returns 500 when trying to delete a tab group.
- **Root cause hypothesis:** The delete endpoint may have a missing column reference, an FK constraint issue, or a bug in the SQL (e.g., trying to update `group_id` on both `graph_tabs` and `saved_tabs` but one of the table references is stale or the query fails).
- **Fix:** Check the `deleteTabGroup` endpoint's SQL. Per the schema, deleting a group should set `group_id = NULL` on member tabs (via `ON DELETE SET NULL` on the FK). The backend endpoint may be trying to do this manually and failing, or it may be trying to delete the `tab_groups` row before properly handling `sidebar_items` references.
- **Files:** Backend controller handling tab groups (likely in the sidebar/tab management routes), `AppShell.jsx`

**Suggested git commit:** `fix: 37e — root concept hiding, tab group deletion`

---

#### Phase 37f: Flip View & Annotation Creation — ✅ COMPLETE

Two bugs related to Flip View display and the annotation creation flow.

**Bug 1 — No sorting options visible in Flip View:**
- **Symptom:** The sort-by-similarity toggle (which should cycle through Sort by Links → Sort by Similarity ↓ → Sort by Similarity ↑) is not visible in Flip View. Per the status doc (Phase 4), this feature exists and should be displayed as flat view options (not a dropdown).
- **Root cause hypothesis:** The sort controls may have been accidentally removed or hidden during a visual cleanup phase (Phase 28a or 30d). The backend similarity computation still exists in `getConceptParents`.
- **Fix:** Verify the sort toggle UI exists in `FlipView.jsx`. If missing, re-add it as a flat horizontal toggle row (matching the Phase 29c sort selector style: `Graph Votes | Similarity ↓ | Similarity ↑`). If present but hidden, fix the rendering condition. Only show in contextual Flip View (similarity requires an origin context).
- **Files:** `FlipView.jsx`

**Bug 2 — Annotation auto-creates when concept is selected:**
- **Symptom:** During annotation creation, selecting a concept immediately creates the annotation before the user has had a chance to add quote text or a comment. The annotation should not be created until the user explicitly confirms.
- **Root cause hypothesis:** The annotation creation flow treats concept selection as the final step and immediately calls `createAnnotation`. There is no intermediate "review and confirm" step.
- **Fix:** Restructure the annotation creation flow to be multi-step with explicit confirmation:
  1. User opens annotation panel (via "Annotate" button or text selection shortcut)
  2. User fills in fields: quote text (optional, pre-filled if text was selected), comment (optional), concept search + selection, context/edge selection
  3. All fields are editable and visible before creation
  4. User clicks a "Create Annotation" confirm button to finalize
  5. Only then does the frontend call the `createAnnotation` API
- **Files:** Annotation creation component (likely in `CorpusTabContent.jsx` or `AnnotationPanel.jsx`)

**Suggested git commit:** `fix: 37f — flip view sorting controls, annotation creation confirm step`

---

#### Phase 37 Architecture Decisions

- **Architecture Decision #214 — Phone Uniqueness Check Moved to Send-Code Step (Phase 37b):** The phone number uniqueness check for registration is moved from `verifyRegister` (after OTP verification) to `sendCode` (before sending the OTP). A new `intent` parameter (`'login'` or `'register'`) on the `sendCode` endpoint controls the behavior: for `register` intent, the endpoint checks `phone_lookup` and rejects if the phone already exists; for `login` intent, no uniqueness check (user must exist). This prevents wasting Twilio API calls and gives users immediate feedback.

- **Architecture Decision #215 — Annotation Creation Requires Explicit Confirmation (Phase 37f):** Annotation creation is changed from "auto-create on concept selection" to a multi-step flow with an explicit "Create Annotation" button. All fields (quote text, comment, concept, context) are visible and editable before creation. This prevents accidental annotations and allows users to add quote text and comments before committing. The text selection shortcut still pre-fills the quote field but does not auto-create.

---

### Phase 38: Post-Launch Enhancements — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** New features and improvements planned for after public launch. Each sub-phase is independent and can be implemented in any order based on user feedback and priorities. Complexity estimates included for planning.

**Completed:** 38a, 38b, 38c, 38d, 38e, 38f, 38g, 38h, 38i, 38j, 38k (all 11)

---

#### Phase 38a: Flip View Navigation Stays on Current Concept — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** Medium

**Current behavior:** Clicking an alt parent card in Flip View navigates to that parent concept's children view (you leave the current concept).

**New behavior:** Clicking an alt parent card switches context — the current concept stays the same, but the graph path updates to show the concept's children as they appear under the clicked parent. The user stays on the same concept but sees it in a different parent context.

**Implementation:**
- `FlipView.jsx`: Change the `onParentClick` handler to navigate within the current concept by updating the path (replacing the current parent context with the clicked parent context) instead of navigating to the parent concept itself.
- `Concept.jsx`: The `navigateInTab` call should keep `conceptId` the same but update the `path` to the clicked parent's context path.
- `AppShell.jsx`: The graph tab update should reflect the new path without changing the concept ID.
- After navigation, the view should switch from Flip View to children view (since you're now viewing the concept in the new context).

**Files:** `FlipView.jsx`, `Concept.jsx`, `AppShell.jsx`

---

#### Phase 38b: Swap Votes on Root-Level Concepts — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** Medium

**Current behavior:** Swap votes (⇄) only work for children of a concept (sibling relationships). Root-level concepts on the root page have no swap vote capability.

**New behavior:** Root concepts can be swap-voted against other root concepts. The ⇄ button appears on root concept cards. The swap modal shows other root concepts as swap targets.

**Implementation:**
- Root edges have `parent_id = NULL` and `graph_path = '{}'`. "Siblings" at the root level are all other root edges (same attribute).
- Backend: Extend swap vote validation to handle root edges. Two root edges are "siblings" if they share the same attribute (since all root edges have `parent_id = NULL` and `graph_path = '{}'`).
- Frontend: Add ⇄ button to root concept cards in `Root.jsx`. Open the `SwapModal` with root context.
- `SwapModal.jsx`: Handle the root case — fetch root siblings via a query for root edges with the same attribute as the target.

**Note:** This should be implemented before or alongside Phase 38c (expanded swap votes) since 38c removes the sibling restriction entirely.

**Files:** `Root.jsx`, `votesController.js`, `SwapModal.jsx`, `conceptsController.js`

---

#### Phase 38c: Expanded Swap Votes — Any Concept via Search — ✅ COMPLETE — ⚠️ REVERSED by Phase 44

**Complexity:** High

**Current behavior:** Swap votes are restricted to siblings (children of the same parent in the same graph context). The backend validates the sibling relationship before accepting a swap vote.

**New behavior:** Any concept in any context can be a swap target. The swap modal includes a search function to find concepts across the entire database. The sibling validation is removed entirely from the backend.

**Implementation:**

**Backend changes (`votesController.js`):**
- Remove the sibling validation check from `addSwapVote`. The `replacement_edge_id` can be any valid edge, not just a sibling.
- Update the `getSwapSuggestions` query to return all existing swap suggestions for the target edge, sorted by vote count descending (no longer filtered to siblings only).
- The `replace_votes` table schema does not need to change — `edge_id` and `replacement_edge_id` are already generic FK references to `edges(id)`.

**Backend changes (`conceptsController.js`) — deferred from Phase 37d:**
- Add `user_swapped` field to the children response in `getConceptWithChildren`. Use a `BOOL_OR(rv.user_id = $userId)` subquery on `replace_votes`, matching the existing `user_voted` pattern for save votes. For guests, pass `-1` as user ID (same as save votes). This enables the frontend `ConceptGrid.jsx` ⇄ button to show per-user active styling (the `swapButtonActive` style is already defined and ready from Phase 37d).

**Frontend changes (`SwapModal.jsx`):**
- **Existing suggestions section:** Show all concepts that have received swap votes for this edge, sorted by vote count (highest first). Each card shows: concept name, attribute badge, parent context path, vote count, and a "Vote" / "Voted" toggle button.
- **Search section:** New search input field (reusing the `SearchField` pattern with debounced `pg_trgm` search). Results show concept name, attribute badge, and all parent contexts. User selects a specific context (edge) to vote for.
- **Navigation:** Each suggestion card and search result card has a navigation icon/button that opens the concept in a new graph tab (so the user can inspect it without losing their place). This is separate from the vote button.
- **No sibling/non-sibling distinction:** The suggestions list doesn't differentiate between siblings and non-siblings. All swap suggestions are treated equally.

**Architecture Decision #216 — Swap Votes Expanded Beyond Siblings (Phase 38c) — ⚠️ REVERSED by Architecture Decision #256 (Phase 44):** The sibling-only restriction on swap votes was removed in Phase 38c. Any concept-in-context (edge) could be proposed as a replacement for any other. **This was reversed in Phase 44** — swap votes are once again restricted to siblings. Cross-context relevance is now expressed via tunneling (Phase 43). See Architecture Decision #256.

#### Phase 38d: Graph Votes Page Revamp — Flat with Corpus Badges — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** Medium-High

**Current behavior:** The Graph Votes page (`SavedPageOverlay.jsx`) organizes saved concept trees into corpus-based tabs (one tab per subscribed corpus, plus "Uncategorized"). Trees are assigned to corpus tabs based on whether any concept in the tree appears as an annotation in that corpus.

**Problem:** Some voted-for concepts are children of annotation concepts but don't appear as annotations themselves. These fall through the corpus tab assignment and are invisible — not shown in any tab.

**New behavior:** Remove corpus tabs entirely. Show ALL graph trees the user has votes in on a single flat page. Trees that contain any concept appearing as an annotation in a subscribed corpus get a corpus badge (or multiple badges if the concept appears in multiple subscribed corpuses). Trees with no corpus associations appear without badges.

**Implementation:**

**Backend changes (`votesController.js`):**
- Simplify the `getUserSaves` endpoint (or create a new one) to return ALL saved edges without corpus tab grouping.
- Add a separate query that maps concept IDs to subscribed corpus names via `document_annotations` → `corpus_subscriptions`. Return this as a `conceptCorpusBadges` lookup alongside the saved edges.

**Frontend changes (`SavedPageOverlay.jsx`):**
- Remove the internal tab bar and corpus tab logic.
- Render all trees in a single scrollable list.
- Each tree card shows corpus badges (small colored pills with corpus name) if any concept in that tree has annotations in subscribed corpuses.
- Trees can still be reordered (the `saved_tree_order_v2` table may need to work without `corpus_id`, or use `corpus_id = NULL` for all entries in the new flat model).
- Sorting: default order by total vote count across the tree, with manual reordering preserved.

**Architecture Decision #217 — Graph Votes Page Flattened (Phase 38d):** The corpus-based tab system on the Graph Votes page is replaced with a single flat list showing all trees. Corpus badges on tree cards indicate annotation membership. This fixes the problem of "missing" trees that fell through corpus assignment (e.g., children of annotation concepts that aren't annotations themselves). The flat view is also simpler to understand — users see everything in one place.

**Files:** `SavedPageOverlay.jsx`, `votesController.js`, `api.js`

---

#### Phase 38e: Color Set Threshold & Count-Based Sorting — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** Medium

**Current behavior:** All vote sets get a color swatch regardless of size (even solo vote sets with 1 user). Swatches are ordered by Jaccard similarity (nearest-neighbor algorithm).

**New behavior:**
- **Threshold:** Only vote sets with 10+ users get a color swatch. Users whose vote pattern matches fewer than 10 people see no swatch for their pattern.
- **Sorting:** Swatches ordered left-to-right by user count (largest set first). Jaccard similarity sorting removed.
- **Scaling (future consideration):** Threshold may scale with total active users to keep color sets representing meaningful consensus. Suggested formula: `threshold = max(10, floor(total_active_users * 0.01))` — at 1,000 users it's 10, at 5,000 it's 50. This can be implemented when there's real user data to calibrate against.

**Implementation:**

**Backend changes (`conceptsController.js`):**
- In `getVoteSets`: After computing vote sets, filter out sets with `userCount < 10` before returning.
- Remove the Jaccard similarity nearest-neighbor sorting logic. Replace with simple `ORDER BY user_count DESC`.
- The `userSetIndex` (which set the current user belongs to) should return `null` if the user's set was filtered out by the threshold.
- `edgeToSets` mapping should only include sets that pass the threshold.

**Frontend changes (`VoteSetBar.jsx`, `Concept.jsx`):**
- Handle the case where the user has no visible swatch (their set was below threshold). No "Your vote set" border highlight in this case.
- Swatches render left-to-right by user count (the backend already returns them sorted).
- Remove any Jaccard-related display logic.

**Architecture Decision #218 — Color Set Visibility Threshold (Phase 38e):** Vote sets with fewer than 10 users are hidden from the color swatch display. This prevents the swatch bar from being cluttered with many small, meaningless patterns when the user base is small. Users below the threshold can still see their own votes (via the ▲ indicators on child cards) but won't see a dedicated color swatch. The threshold may be scaled with total user count in the future. Swatches are ordered by user count (largest first) instead of Jaccard similarity, since the similarity ordering was confusing and the primary signal is "how many people share this pattern."

**Files:** `conceptsController.js`, `VoteSetBar.jsx`, `Concept.jsx`

---

#### Phase 38f: Filter Annotations by Attribute — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** Low-Medium

**Current behavior:** The annotation panel for a document shows all annotations regardless of attribute. The only filters are identity-based (All | Corpus Members | Author).

**New behavior:** Add attribute filter toggles below the identity filter: `All | Value | Action | Tool | Question`. These are flat horizontal toggles (matching the identity filter style). The attribute filter composes with the identity filter — you can view "Author annotations that are [value]" by selecting both.

**Implementation:**
- Frontend-only filter on existing annotation data (annotations already include `attribute_name` via the edge join).
- New state variable `attributeFilter` in `CorpusTabContent.jsx` (default: `'all'`).
- Filter annotations client-side before rendering: if `attributeFilter !== 'all'`, only show annotations where `annotation.attribute_name === attributeFilter`.
- Toggle row renders below the identity filter row, same styling (flat buttons with active/inactive states).
- Only show enabled attributes (from `ENABLED_ATTRIBUTES` env var, already available via `getAttributes` API).

**Files:** `CorpusTabContent.jsx`

---

#### Phase 38g: Sort Annotations by Quote Position — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** Medium

**Current behavior:** Annotations are sorted by vote count descending.

**New behavior:** Add a "Sort by Position" option that orders annotations by where their `quote_text` appears in the document body. Annotations with no `quote_text` appear at the top (they're document-level annotations with no specific location). This sort option can be combined with the attribute filter (Phase 38f) — e.g., view only [value] annotations sorted by position.

**Implementation:**
- At render time, for each annotation with `quote_text`, compute the position by searching for `quote_text` in the document body (using `indexOf` or the same `TreeWalker` logic used for quote navigation). Use `quote_occurrence` to disambiguate multiple matches.
- Cache computed positions to avoid re-searching on every render.
- New sort toggle: `Votes | Position` (flat horizontal, composable with attribute filter).
- Annotations with no `quote_text` get position `-1` (sort to top).
- Secondary sort within same position: vote count descending.

**Files:** `CorpusTabContent.jsx`

---

#### Phase 38h: Add as Annotation from Graph View — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** High

**Current behavior:** Annotations can only be created from the document viewer (inside a corpus tab). To annotate a document with a concept, you must first navigate to the document, then create the annotation.

**New behavior:** A new "Add as Annotation" button in the concept view (graph context) lets users annotate documents with the current concept without leaving the graph. Opens a picker modal listing subscribed corpuses with their documents. Clicking a document navigates to the corpus tab doc viewer with the annotation creation panel pre-filled with the current concept and edge. Existing annotations for that concept on each document are shown inline in the picker to prevent duplicates.

**Implementation:**

**New backend endpoint:**
- `GET /api/corpuses/:corpusId/documents/:documentId/annotations-for-concept/:conceptId` — guest-accessible via `optionalAuth`. Returns all annotations on a document within a corpus that reference any edge where `child_id = conceptId`. Includes parent context info (parent_name, graph_path, attribute_name), creator username, vote_count, user_voted. Uses LEFT JOIN on users and concepts (SET NULL FK safety). Sorted by vote_count DESC, created_at DESC.

**New picker component (`AnnotateFromGraphPicker.jsx`):**
- Lightweight corpus/document picker modal — no annotation creation form inside.
- Lists subscribed corpuses as expandable sections with document counts.
- Expanded corpus shows documents; for each document, fetches existing annotations via the Part 1 endpoint and filters to the current edge for duplicate detection.
- Existing annotations shown inline below document cards (quote text + comment, truncated).
- Clicking a document triggers navigation to the corpus tab doc viewer.

**Navigation flow (via existing pending-document pattern):**
- `Concept.jsx` → `onAnnotateFromGraph` callback → `AppShell.handleAnnotateFromGraph` auto-subscribes to corpus if needed, sets `pendingCorpusDocumentId` + `pendingAnnotationFromGraph`, switches to corpus tab → `CorpusTabContent` opens the document and the annotation creation panel with concept/edge pre-filled via new `prefilledConcept`/`prefilledEdge` props on `AnnotationPanel.jsx`.

**Frontend integration:**
- "Add as Annotation" button appears in concept view header, only in children view (not flip view), only for logged-in users with a parent edge context.
- `AnnotationPanel.jsx` accepts optional `prefilledConcept` and `prefilledEdge` props that skip concept search and context picker steps.

**Files:** New `AnnotateFromGraphPicker.jsx`, modified `AnnotationPanel.jsx`, `Concept.jsx`, `AppShell.jsx`, `CorpusTabContent.jsx`, `corpusController.js`, `corpuses.js` (route), `api.js`

---

#### Phase 38i: Delete Any Document Version — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** Low (frontend-only fix)

**Problem:** Only the latest version could be deleted — the delete button was restricted to the most recent version in the version navigator.

**Investigation result:** The backend `deleteDocument` endpoint already accepted any version ID. The restriction was frontend-only — `CorpusTabContent.jsx` only rendered the delete button for the latest version in the version chain.

**Fix:** Extended the delete button to appear on all versions in the version history panel, with confirmation dialogs. Deleting a mid-chain version sets `source_document_id = NULL` on downstream versions (via `ON DELETE SET NULL`), which the UI handles gracefully.

**Files:** `CorpusTabContent.jsx`

---

#### Phase 38j: Annotation Citation Links — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** High

**Goal:** Enable users to cite Orca annotations in external research documents. When those documents are later uploaded to Orca, cited annotations are automatically detected and displayed.

**User flow:**
1. User views Document A in Orca, sees a useful annotation
2. Clicks "Cite" button on the annotation → plain URL copied to clipboard (e.g., `https://orca.app/cite/a/456`)
3. User pastes URL into their research doc (Google Docs, Word, etc.)
4. User uploads their document to Orca as Document B
5. During text extraction, backend scans for `orca.app/cite/a/` URLs via regex
6. For each detected citation URL, backend resolves the annotation ID, stores a row in `document_citation_links` with snapshot metadata (concept name, quote snippet, document title, corpus name) for dead-link resilience
7. Document B's annotation panel shows a "Cited Annotations" section listing all detected citations as cards
8. Citation URLs in Document B's body render as clickable links in the document viewer
9. Clicking a citation card (or body link) navigates to the annotation in Document A's corpus context

**New database table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE document_citation_links (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  citing_document_id INTEGER REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  cited_annotation_id INTEGER REFERENCES document_annotations(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  citation_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  snapshot_concept_name VARCHAR(255),
  snapshot_quote_text TEXT,
  snapshot_document_title VARCHAR(500),
  snapshot_corpus_name VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_citation_links_citing_doc ON document_citation_links(citing_document_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_citation_links_cited_annotation ON document_citation_links(cited_annotation_id);
```

**Key design decisions:**
- `cited_annotation_id` uses `ON DELETE SET NULL` — when the original annotation's document is deleted (cascading to the annotation), the citation row survives with `cited_annotation_id = NULL` but snapshot fields still show useful info.
- Detection happens at upload time and version upload time only (no re-scanning).
- Citation URLs are plain format: `https://{domain}/cite/a/{annotation_id}`.
- Non-Orca users visiting the URL see a login prompt.
- Snapshot metadata stored at detection time: `snapshot_concept_name`, `snapshot_quote_text`, `snapshot_document_title`, `snapshot_corpus_name`. These survive even if the original annotation or document is later deleted.

**Backend work:**
- **Citation URL generation:** No backend change needed — the URL format is deterministic from the annotation ID. Frontend generates it.
- **Citation detection in upload pipeline:** After text extraction in `uploadDocument` and `createVersion`, run a regex scan for `cite/a/(\d+)` URLs. For each match, resolve the annotation ID, fetch snapshot data (concept name via edge → concept join, quote text, document title, corpus name), and batch-insert into `document_citation_links`.
- **New endpoint:** `GET /api/documents/:id/citations` — returns all citation links for a document. For each citation: if `cited_annotation_id` is not null, fetch live annotation data (current concept name, quote text, document title, corpus name, annotation ID for navigation). If null, return snapshot data with an "unavailable" flag.
- **Citation URL route:** `/cite/a/:annotationId` — resolves to the correct corpus + document view with the annotation highlighted. If the user is not logged in, show the login modal. If the annotation no longer exists, show a "this annotation is no longer available" message.

**Frontend work:**
- **"Cite" button** on each annotation card in the document viewer. Copies the citation URL to clipboard. Shows brief "Copied!" confirmation tooltip.
- **"Cited Annotations" section** in the annotation panel for documents that have citations. Renders below the main annotations list. Each citation card shows: concept name, quote snippet (truncated), source document title, corpus name. Uses live data when annotation exists; snapshot data with "(no longer available)" indicator when it doesn't.
- **Citation card click:** Navigates to the source document in the correct corpus tab, scrolling to and highlighting the cited annotation. If the annotation is unavailable, shows a message.
- **Body link rendering:** In the document body, citation URLs (`cite/a/...`) are detected and rendered as styled clickable links (underlined, distinguished from regular text). Clicking a body link has the same navigation behavior as clicking the citation card.

**Architecture Decision #219 — Citation Links with Dead-Link Resilience (Phase 38j):** Annotation citations store snapshot metadata at detection time (concept name, quote text, document title, corpus name) in addition to the annotation FK. When the cited annotation's document is deleted (cascading to the annotation row), the `cited_annotation_id` becomes NULL via `ON DELETE SET NULL`, but the snapshot fields preserve enough information to display a meaningful "this annotation is no longer available" card. This is consistent with Orca's philosophy of preserving provenance information even when source entities are removed.

**Files:** `migrate.js`, `corpusController.js` (upload pipeline + citation resolution), `routes/citations.js`, `routes/documents.js`, `api.js`, `CorpusTabContent.jsx` (annotation panel + body renderer + cite button + cited annotations section), `CitationRedirect.jsx`, `App.jsx` (citation URL route)

#### Phase 38k: Search Result Corpus Badge Tooltip + "Saved" → "Voted" Rename — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** Low

**Changes:**
1. **Corpus badge tooltip:** When search results show corpus annotation badges, hovering shows the specific document title(s) where the concept is annotated in that corpus. Tooltip rendered via `ReactDOM.createPortal` into `document.body` with fixed positioning above the badge — avoids affecting dropdown layout.
2. **"Saved" → "Voted" rename:** The green badge on search results for concepts the user has voted on now says "Voted" instead of showing the saved tab name (which was "Saved").

**Backend:** Extended the corpus annotation surfacing query in `searchConcepts` to JOIN `documents` and return `documentTitles` array per corpus (via `array_agg`-style grouping in JS).

**Frontend:** Portal-based tooltip on corpus badges showing "Annotated in: Doc1, Doc2, ..." on hover (truncated at 4 titles with "and N more"). Badge text changed from `result.savedTabs.map(t => t.tabName)` to static "Voted".

**Files:** `conceptsController.js`, `SearchField.jsx`

### Phase 39: Combos — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Let users group concepts-in-context (edges) from across different graphs and attributes into named collections called "combos." A combo page shows all annotations attached to its member edges, with filtering, sorting, and combo-specific voting. Users subscribe to combos for persistent sidebar tabs.

**UI terminology:** "Combo" everywhere (database tables, API, frontend). The Browse page is "Browse Combos." Sidebar tabs show the combo name.

---

#### Phase 39a: Backend Infrastructure — Tables, CRUD, Subscriptions — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** High

**New database tables:** `combos`, `combo_edges`, `combo_subscriptions`, `combo_annotation_votes` (see Database Schema section for full schemas).

**New API endpoints (`/api/combos`):**

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/` | Guest OK | List all combos (with creator username, edge count, annotation count, subscriber count). Supports `?search=` for name search and `?sort=new|subscribers` (default: subscribers). |
| GET | `/:id` | Guest OK | Get combo details + list of member edges with concept names, paths, attributes |
| GET | `/:id/annotations` | Required | Get all annotations across all edges in the combo. Supports `?sort=combo_votes|subscribed|new|annotation_votes` (default: combo_votes), `?edgeIds=1,2,3` for subconcept filtering. Returns annotation data with concept badges, both combo vote count and corpus-level vote count, `subscribed_vote_count`, user vote status for both. |
| POST | `/create` | Required | Create a new combo (name, description). Creator auto-subscribes. |
| GET | `/mine` | Required | List combos owned by the current user (for the "Add to Combo" picker) |
| GET | `/subscriptions` | Required | Get current user's combo subscriptions with details |
| POST | `/subscribe` | Required | Subscribe to a combo (creates sidebar item) |
| POST | `/unsubscribe` | Required | Unsubscribe from a combo (removes sidebar item) |
| POST | `/:id/edges/add` | Owner only | Add an edge to the combo. Body: `{ edgeId }`. Returns 409 if already in combo. |
| POST | `/:id/edges/remove` | Owner only | Remove an edge from the combo. Body: `{ edgeId }`. |
| POST | `/:id/annotations/vote` | Required | Vote on an annotation within this combo context |
| POST | `/:id/annotations/unvote` | Required | Remove combo vote on an annotation |

**Sidebar integration:**
- New `item_type: 'combo'` in `sidebar_items` table
- Subscribe/unsubscribe auto-manage `sidebar_items` rows (same pattern as corpuses)

**Files:** `migrate.js`, new `comboController.js`, new `routes/combos.js`, `server.js`, `api.js`, `votesController.js` (sidebar items update)

**Suggested git commit:** `feat: 39a — combo backend infrastructure, CRUD, subscriptions, combo annotation votes`

---

#### Phase 39b: Browse Combos Overlay — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** Medium

**New sidebar button:** "Browse Combos" alongside existing "Browse Corpuses" button (rename current "Browse" to "Browse Corpuses").

**Browse Combos overlay** (same pattern as corpus browse — full-page overlay via AppShell state):
- Lists all combos in the system as cards
- Each card shows: combo name, description (truncated), creator username, subconcept count, annotation count, subscriber count
- Search bar for filtering by name (frontend filter on loaded data, or backend `?search=` param for scalability)
- Sort toggle: New (created_at desc) | Subscribers (count desc)
- Subscribe/Unsubscribe button on each card
- Clicking a combo name subscribes (if not already) and switches to the combo's persistent tab

**Files:** New `ComboListView.jsx`, `AppShell.jsx` (sidebar button + overlay state), `api.js`

**Suggested git commit:** `feat: 39b — Browse Combos overlay with search, sort, subscribe`

---

#### Phase 39c: Combo Page (Persistent Tab) — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** High

**New component:** `ComboTabContent.jsx` — rendered in main content area when a combo tab is active (same pattern as `CorpusTabContent.jsx`).

**Layout:**
- Header: combo name, description, creator username, subscriber count, unsubscribe button
- Owner controls (visible to owner only): "Add Subconcept" button opening a search/picker, list of current subconcepts with remove buttons
- Subconcept filter bar: clickable concept badges (multi-select toggle) to filter annotations to specific subconcepts
- Sort toggle: Combo Votes | Subscribed | New | Annotation Votes (Subscribed hidden for guests)
- Annotation card list: flat list of annotation cards, each showing:
  - Document title (clickable — navigates to document in corpus context)
  - Quote text (if present)
  - Comment (if present)
  - Concept badge(s) indicating which subconcept edge this annotation belongs to
  - Combo vote count + vote button (combo-specific)
  - Corpus-level vote count (read-only display)
  - Creator username
- Empty states: no subconcepts yet (owner prompt to add), subconcepts but no annotations

**Add subconcept picker (owner only):**
- Search field using existing concept search (`/api/concepts/search`)
- Results show concept name + attribute + parent context path
- Selecting a result shows available edges (contexts) for that concept
- Owner picks a specific edge to add to the combo
- Confirmation feedback + badge appears in filter bar

**Click-through navigation:**
- Clicking a document title on an annotation card navigates to the document in its corpus context (same pending-document pattern as ConceptAnnotationPanel click-through: auto-subscribe to corpus if needed, set pendingCorpusDocumentId + pendingAnnotationId, switch to corpus tab)

**Files:** New `ComboTabContent.jsx`, `AppShell.jsx` (combo tab rendering, pending navigation), `api.js`

**Suggested git commit:** `feat: 39c — combo persistent tab with annotation list, filtering, sorting, combo votes, owner subconcept management`

---

#### Phase 39d: Add to Combo from Graph View — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** Medium

**New UI:** "Add to Combo" button on concept cards in children view. Only visible to logged-in users who own at least one combo.

**Flow:**
1. User clicks "Add to Combo" on a concept card in children view
2. Picker modal shows the user's owned combos (fetched via `GET /api/combos/mine`)
3. User selects a combo
4. Backend adds the edge to the combo (or shows "already in combo" if duplicate)
5. Brief confirmation feedback

**Implementation:**
- Button appears in `ConceptGrid.jsx` alongside ▲ vote and ⇄ swap buttons
- Picker component similar to the saved tab picker pattern — lightweight modal/dropdown
- Uses existing `POST /api/combos/:id/edges/add` endpoint

**Files:** `ConceptGrid.jsx`, new picker component (or inline in ConceptGrid), `api.js`

**Suggested git commit:** `feat: 39d — add to combo from graph view with combo picker`

---

#### Phase 39e: Polish & Edge Cases — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** Low-Medium

**Tasks:**
- Sidebar drag-and-drop integration for combo tabs (update `SidebarDndContext.jsx` to handle `item_type: 'combo'`)
- Combo tabs rendered with `display: none` when inactive (same hide-not-unmount pattern as corpus/graph tabs)
- Tab groups: combo tabs can be placed in tab groups alongside corpus and graph tabs
- Graph tab placement: graph tabs can be placed inside combo sidebar items (update `user_corpus_tab_placements` or create parallel table)
- Frontend build verification (`npm run build`)
- Test Level 1 regression sweep

**Files:** `SidebarDndContext.jsx`, `AppShell.jsx`, `votesController.js` (tab group handling)

**Suggested git commit:** `feat: 39e — combo sidebar polish, drag-and-drop, tab groups, build verification`

---

#### Phase 39 Architecture Decisions

- **Architecture Decision #220 — Combos Are Permanent (Phase 39):** Combos cannot be deleted, matching Orca's append-only philosophy. There is no archive or retire mechanism. A combo with zero subscribers still appears in Browse Combos. If the owner deletes their account, the combo persists but becomes ownerless (no one can add/remove edges). Future: ownership transfer could be added following the corpus transfer pattern (Phase 35b).

- **Architecture Decision #221 — Combo Votes Are Independent from Corpus Votes (Phase 39):** The `combo_annotation_votes` table is separate from `annotation_votes`. An annotation's combo vote count and corpus vote count are completely independent numbers. Both are displayed on combo page annotation cards. This reflects that an annotation's value in a combo context may differ from its value in its original corpus context — different communities may weight the same annotation differently.

- **Architecture Decision #222 — Hidden Edges Remain Visible in Combos (Phase 39):** When an edge is hidden via moderation (`is_hidden = true`), its annotations still appear on combo pages that include that edge. The combo owner's deliberate act of adding the edge implies a level of trust. This differs from graph views where hidden edges are filtered out.

- **Architecture Decision #223 — Browse Combos Renamed from Browse Button (Phase 39):** The existing "Browse" sidebar button is renamed to "Browse Corpuses" and a new "Browse Combos" button is added alongside it. Both open full-page overlays with the same interaction pattern. Sidebar action buttons use a 2x2 grid layout.

- **Architecture Decision #224 — Combo Tabs Support Tab Groups (Phase 39e):** Combo tabs can be placed in tab groups alongside graph tabs via right-click context menu or drag-and-drop. The `combo_subscriptions` table has a `group_id` FK to `tab_groups` (ON DELETE SET NULL). The `addTabToGroup` and `removeTabFromGroup` backend endpoints support `tabType: 'combo'`. This is consistent with the mixed tab type group model from Phase 5d.

- **Architecture Decision #225 — Combo Owner Account Deletion Uses ON DELETE SET NULL (Phase 39e):** The `combos.created_by` FK uses `ON DELETE SET NULL` rather than blocking deletion. When a combo owner deletes their account, the combo becomes ownerless — `created_by = NULL`, frontend shows "[deleted user]", and no one can add/remove edges. Subscribers can still view the combo and its annotations. This is consistent with how other provenance FKs work (Phase 35c).

- **Architecture Decision #226 — Invite Link Generation Supports Optional Limits (Phase 39e):** Corpus invite link generation now supports optional `maxUses` and `expiresInDays` parameters. The backend already supported these fields since Phase 7g; the frontend inline form in `CorpusMembersPanel` was added in Phase 39e. Leaving both fields blank creates an unlimited, non-expiring link (backwards compatible).

---

### Phase 40: Subscribed Sort Option for Annotations — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Add a "Subscribed" sort option that ranks annotations by votes from members of corpuses the user subscribes to. This surfaces annotations endorsed by people in the user's trusted communities.

**Definition of "subscribed members":** For a given user, subscribed members = the set of all corpus owners (`corpuses.created_by`) and allowed users (`corpus_allowed_users.user_id`) across all corpuses the user is subscribed to (`corpus_subscriptions`).

**Implementation:**

**Backend — CTE pattern (used in all three controllers):**
Each controller builds a `subscribed_members` CTE:
```sql
WITH subscribed_members AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT member_id FROM (
    SELECT c.created_by AS member_id
    FROM corpus_subscriptions cs
    JOIN corpuses c ON c.id = cs.corpus_id
    WHERE cs.user_id = $userId AND c.created_by IS NOT NULL
    UNION
    SELECT cau.user_id AS member_id
    FROM corpus_subscriptions cs
    JOIN corpus_allowed_users cau ON cau.corpus_id = cs.corpus_id
    WHERE cs.user_id = $userId
  ) sub
)
```
Then computes `subscribed_vote_count` per annotation via a LEFT JOIN subquery counting `annotation_votes` where `user_id IN (SELECT member_id FROM subscribed_members)`.

**Backend files modified:**
- `corpusController.js` — `getDocumentAnnotations`: added `?sort=subscribed` option, returns `subscribed_vote_count`
- `conceptsController.js` — `getConceptAnnotations`: added `?sort=subscribed` option, returns `subscribed_vote_count`
- `comboController.js` — `getComboAnnotations`: added `?sort=subscribed` option, returns `subscribed_vote_count`

**Frontend files modified:**
- `CorpusTabContent.jsx` — sort bar: Votes | Subscribed | Position (Subscribed hidden for guests)
- `ConceptAnnotationPanel.jsx` — sort toggle: Top | Subscribed | New (Subscribed hidden for guests)
- `ComboTabContent.jsx` — sort toggle: Combo Votes | Subscribed | New | Annotation Votes (Subscribed hidden for guests)
- `api.js` — updated API methods to pass `sort=subscribed` parameter

**Key design decisions:**
- **Guest-hidden:** The Subscribed sort toggle is not rendered for guest users since they have no subscriptions.
- **Secondary sort:** When sorting by subscribed votes, ties are broken by total `vote_count` descending.
- **No new database tables:** The feature composes existing tables (`corpus_subscriptions`, `corpuses`, `corpus_allowed_users`, `annotation_votes`) via CTEs.
- **Independent of combo votes:** In ComboTabContent, `subscribed_vote_count` is computed from corpus-level `annotation_votes`, not `combo_annotation_votes`.

**Architecture Decision #227 — Subscribed Sort Uses Corpus Membership as Trust Signal (Phase 40):** The "Subscribed" sort option uses corpus membership (owners + allowed users of subscribed corpuses) as a proxy for trusted community. This surfaces annotations endorsed by people the user has chosen to follow via corpus subscriptions, without requiring an explicit "follow user" feature. The CTE is computed per-request — no denormalization or caching needed at current scale.

**Suggested git commit:** `feat: add Subscribed sort option for annotations across corpus, concept, and combo views`

### Phase 40b: Password Login with Phone OTP for Registration & Password Reset — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Replace phone-OTP-every-time login with standard username/email + password login. Phone OTP retained only for registration (verify phone is real) and password reset (prove identity).

**Implementation:**

**Backend changes:**
- New `POST /auth/login` endpoint — accepts `{ identifier, password }`, detects username vs email by `@`, rate-limited 10 req/IP/15 min
- Updated `POST /auth/verify-register` — now requires `password` field, validates with zxcvbn before Twilio call, hashes and stores `password_hash`
- Removed `POST /auth/verify-login` (OTP login no longer exists)
- New `POST /auth/forgot-password/send-code` — accepts phone number, looks up user via HMAC, sends OTP, returns generic message
- New `POST /auth/forgot-password/reset` — verifies OTP, validates new password with zxcvbn, updates `password_hash`, auto-login with JWT
- Added `zxcvbn` dependency for NIST SP 800-63B compliant password strength checking
- Migration sets test user passwords (alice-frank) to `testpass123!`

**Frontend changes:**
- `LoginModal.jsx` redesigned with three modes: Log In (identifier + password), Sign Up (3-step: phone OTP → details + password), Forgot Password (3-step: phone OTP → new password)
- Password visibility toggle on all password fields
- `AuthContext.jsx` updated: added `login()`, `forgotPasswordSendCode()`, `forgotPasswordReset()`; updated `phoneRegister` to pass password; removed `phoneLogin`
- `api.js` updated: added `login`, `forgotPasswordSendCode`, `forgotPasswordReset`; updated `verifyRegister` with password param; removed `verifyLogin`

**Architecture Decision #228 — Password Login Replaces OTP Login (Phase 40b):** Normal login uses username/email + password. Phone OTP is used only during registration (to verify the phone is real) and during password reset (to prove identity). The `verify-login` endpoint is removed. The `password_hash` column on `users` (dormant since Phase 32d) is reactivated.

**Architecture Decision #229 — Password Strength via zxcvbn (Phase 40b):** Passwords must be at least 8 characters and score >= 2 on the zxcvbn scale (0-4). This follows NIST SP 800-63B: enforce minimum length, check against common/breached passwords, no arbitrary complexity rules. The zxcvbn library is passed the user's username and email as penalty inputs.

**Architecture Decision #230 — Forgot Password Uses Phone Number as Identifier (Phase 40b):** The forgot-password flow requires the user to enter their phone number because phone numbers are stored as irreversible hashes. The endpoint returns a generic success message regardless of whether the phone exists (prevents account enumeration).

**Suggested git commit:** `feat: 40b — password login with phone OTP for registration and password reset, zxcvbn strength validation`

### Phase 41: ORCID Integration, Document External Links, Corpus Invite Enhancements — 🔲 PLANNED

**Goal:** Three interconnected features: (1) users can verify and link their ORCID iD via OAuth, with verified iDs displayed as subtle icons next to usernames; (2) documents can have an external source URL (e.g., arXiv) visible to all users; (3) corpus owners can invite members by searching usernames or ORCID iDs, in addition to the existing invite link method.

#### Phase 41a: Profile Page + ORCID OAuth Verification — 🔲 PLANNED

**Goal:** Add a user profile page accessible by clicking any username. The logged-in user's own profile includes a "Connect ORCID" button that initiates the ORCID OAuth flow to verify and store their ORCID iD. Other users' profiles are read-only.

**Database changes:**
- Add `orcid_id VARCHAR(19)` column to `users` table (nullable)
- Add unique partial index: `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_users_orcid ON users(orcid_id) WHERE orcid_id IS NOT NULL`

**New environment variables:** `ORCID_CLIENT_ID`, `ORCID_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ORCID_REDIRECT_URI`

**Backend changes:**
- New `GET /api/auth/orcid/authorize-url` — returns ORCID OAuth URL with `/authenticate` scope
- New `POST /api/auth/orcid/callback` — exchanges authorization code for verified ORCID iD via server-to-server token exchange (`POST https://orcid.org/oauth/token`), stores on user row, 409 if duplicate
- New `POST /api/auth/orcid/disconnect` — sets `orcid_id = NULL`
- New `GET /api/users/:id/profile` — returns public profile data (username, orcid_id, created_at, corpus count, document count)

**Frontend changes:**
- New `ProfilePage.jsx` — route `/profile/:userId`, shows username, ORCID link (if set), stats. Owner sees Connect/Disconnect ORCID button.
- New `OrcidCallback.jsx` — route `/orcid/callback`, extracts `code` query param, calls backend, redirects to profile
- AppShell header username becomes clickable link to own profile
- New routes in `App.jsx`: `/profile/:userId`, `/orcid/callback`
- New API functions: `getOrcidAuthorizeUrl()`, `orcidCallback(code)`, `disconnectOrcid()`, `getUserProfile(userId)`

**ORCID OAuth flow:**
1. User clicks "Connect ORCID" → frontend calls `GET /api/auth/orcid/authorize-url`
2. Backend returns URL: `https://orcid.org/oauth/authorize?client_id=APP-XXX&response_type=code&scope=/authenticate&redirect_uri=...`
3. Frontend redirects to this URL (window.location)
4. User authenticates at ORCID, grants access → ORCID redirects to `/orcid/callback?code=XYZ`
5. `OrcidCallback.jsx` catches route, sends `POST /api/auth/orcid/callback` with `{ code }`
6. Backend exchanges code via `POST https://orcid.org/oauth/token` → gets `{ orcid: "0000-0001-2345-6789" }`
7. Backend stores `orcid_id`, returns success → frontend redirects to profile page

**Architecture Decisions:** #231 (OAuth only, no manual entry), #232 (access tokens not stored), #233 (read-only for others), #234 (uniqueness via partial index)

**Pre-requisites:** Register for ORCID Public API credentials (free) at orcid.org Developer Tools. For development, use ORCID sandbox (`sandbox.orcid.org`). Register `http://localhost:3000/orcid/callback` as redirect URI for dev, `https://orcaconcepts.org/orcid/callback` for production.

#### Phase 41b: ORCID Display Across UI — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Where Orca displays a username and that user has a verified ORCID, show a small green ORCID iD icon next to the name that links to their ORCID profile in a new tab.

**Backend changes:** Modified 11 queries across 3 controllers to include `orcid_id` in user-related response data (via existing LEFT JOIN to users table):
- `GET /api/corpuses` — `owner_orcid_id` (listCorpuses)
- `GET /api/corpuses/:id` — `owner_orcid_id` on corpus, `uploader_orcid_id` on documents (getCorpus)
- `GET /api/corpuses/:corpusId/allowed-users` — `orcid_id` per member (listAllowedUsers)
- `GET /api/corpuses/:corpusId/documents/:documentId/annotations` — `creator_orcid_id` (getDocumentAnnotations)
- `GET /api/corpuses/:corpusId/documents/:documentId/annotations-for-concept/:conceptId` — `created_by_orcid_id` (getAnnotationsForConceptOnDocument)
- `GET /api/concepts/:id/annotations` — `creatorOrcidId` (camelCase, getAnnotationsForConcept)
- `GET /api/documents/:id` — `uploader_orcid_id` on document, `owner_orcid_id` on corpuses (getDocument)
- `GET /api/corpuses/versions/:documentId/history` — `uploader_orcid_id` per version (getVersionHistory)
- `GET /api/combos` — `creator_orcid_id` (listCombos)
- `GET /api/combos/:id` — `creator_orcid_id` (getCombo)
- `GET /api/combos/:id/annotations` — `creator_orcid_id` (getComboAnnotations)

**Frontend changes:**
- New `OrcidBadge.jsx` — accepts `orcidId` prop, renders small inline green "iD" text badge (ORCID brand color `#a6ce39`, sans-serif font, 10px) linking to `https://orcid.org/{orcidId}` in new tab. Hover darkens to filled green. Renders nothing if orcidId is falsy.
- Update `CorpusListView.jsx` — badge next to corpus owner names (both My Corpuses and All Corpuses sections)
- Update `CorpusDetailView.jsx` — badge next to corpus owner name in header
- Update `CorpusMembersPanel.jsx` — badge next to each member username in list and transfer ownership panel
- Update `CorpusTabContent.jsx` — badge next to document uploader name, annotation creator names, and version history uploader names
- Update `ConceptAnnotationPanel.jsx` — badge next to annotation creator names
- Update `ComboListView.jsx` — badge next to combo creator names
- Update `ComboTabContent.jsx` — badge next to combo creator name in header and annotation creator names

**Architecture Decisions:** #235 (icon is a link, not tooltip), #236 (strategic placement — authorship/membership contexts only)

#### Phase 41c: Document External Links — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Allow document authors to attach external source URLs (arXiv links, DOIs, journal URLs) to a document. Multiple links per document. Links display at the top of the document viewer for all users. All versions share one set of links via root document storage.

**Database changes:**
- New `document_external_links` table — `id`, `document_id` (FK to root doc, ON DELETE CASCADE), `url` (TEXT), `added_by` (FK to users, ON DELETE SET NULL), `created_at`
- Index on `document_id` for fast lookups
- Originally implemented as a single `external_url` column on `documents`; redesigned to a separate table to support multiple links per document

**Backend changes:**
- New `GET /api/documents/:id/external-links` — guest-accessible. Returns all links for a document, resolving to root document via `getRootDocumentId()`. LEFT JOIN on users for `added_by_username`.
- New `POST /api/documents/:id/external-links/add` — author-only (`isDocumentAuthor` check). URL validation (http/https, max 2000 chars). Duplicate URL returns 409.
- New `POST /api/documents/:id/external-links/:linkId/remove` — author-only. Verifies link belongs to the document's root.
- Three handlers in `corpusController.js`: `getDocumentExternalLinks`, `addDocumentExternalLink`, `removeDocumentExternalLink`
- Three routes in `documents.js`

**Frontend changes:**
- `api.js` — three new methods in `documentsAPI`: `getExternalLinks`, `addExternalLink`, `removeExternalLink`
- `CorpusTabContent.jsx` — external links display below document metadata, above body. Each link shows truncated URL (60 chars) with ↗ icon. Authors see ✕ remove buttons and "+ Add source link" toggle with inline input form. State: `externalLinks`, `showAddExternalLink`, `externalLinkInput`. Links loaded alongside citations when document opens; state cleared on back-to-list.
- Upload form does NOT include an external link field — authors add links after upload via the doc viewer UI (cleaner for multiple links)

**Architecture Decisions:** #200 (multiple links via root doc table), #201 (authors-only edit), #202 (display below metadata)

#### Phase 41d: Corpus Invite by Username/ORCID Lookup — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Expand corpus invitation to support three methods: invite link (existing), search by username, and search by ORCID. Direct-add (no accept/decline notification flow).

**Backend changes:**
- New `GET /api/users/search` — in `usersController.js`. Search by username (ILIKE prefix match) or ORCID iD (exact or prefix match). Query: `?q=searchterm` (min 2 chars, returns 400 if shorter). Auth required. Max 10 results. Excludes requesting user. Auto-detects ORCID format via regex `/^\d{4}(-\d{4}){0,2}(-\d{3}[\dX])?$/` — full 19-char ORCID does exact match, partial prefix uses LIKE.
- New `POST /api/corpuses/:id/invite-user` — in `corpusController.js`. Owner-only. Body: `{ userId }`. Validation chain: corpus exists (404), target user exists (404), target is not owner (400), target not already a member (409). Inserts into `corpus_allowed_users`. Returns `{ success: true, user: { id, username, orcidId } }`.

**Frontend changes:**
- `api.js` — new `usersAPI.searchUsers(query)` and `corpusAPI.inviteUserToCorpus(corpusId, userId)`
- `CorpusMembersPanel.jsx` — new "Add member" section between invite links and member list (owner-only). Text input with placeholder "Search by username or ORCID", debounced 300ms with `useRef` timer, min 2 chars. Dropdown results show username + OrcidBadge + "Add" button. On success: "Added ✓" feedback (1.5s), then auto-clears input/results and refreshes member list via `onMembersChanged` callback. On 409: "Already a member". `onMouseDown={e => e.preventDefault()}` on Add button prevents input blur from closing dropdown before click registers. `blurTimerRef` with 200ms delay handles focus/blur gracefully.
- `CorpusTabContent.jsx` and `CorpusDetailView.jsx` — pass `corpusId` and `onMembersChanged` (loadMembers/loadAllowedUsers) props to CorpusMembersPanel

**Architecture Decisions:** #240 (direct add, not invitation), #241 (search requires auth), #242 (ORCID exact match)

#### Phase 41 Implementation Priority (completed)

1. ~~**41a** (Profile page + ORCID OAuth)~~ ✅
2. ~~**41b** (ORCID display in UI)~~ ✅
3. ~~**41c** (Document external links)~~ ✅
4. ~~**41d** (Corpus invite by username/ORCID)~~ ✅

---

### Phase 42: Superconcepts Rename, Document Coauthor Lookup, Superconcept Ownership Transfer, Corpus Member Document Removal

**Goal:** Four improvements: (1) rename "combos" to "superconcepts" in the UI; (2) add username/ORCID search to document coauthor invitations (mirroring Phase 41d corpus invite pattern); (3) add superconcept ownership transfer with username/ORCID lookup, and require transfer before account deletion; (4) allow corpus members to remove documents they personally added to a corpus.

---

#### Phase 42a: Rename Combos → Superconcepts (UI Only) — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Rename all user-facing references from "combo(s)" to "superconcept(s)". No database changes, no API route changes, no table renames — purely UI string replacements. Internal code (variable names, file names, API routes, table names) stays as-is to avoid unnecessary churn.

**Backend changes:**
- None. API routes remain `/api/combos/*`.

**Frontend changes:**
- `ComboListView.jsx` — title "Browse Superconcepts", search placeholder "Search superconcepts...", create button "New Superconcept", empty states, all visible text
- `ComboTabContent.jsx` — tab labels, header text, owner labels, empty states, all visible text referencing "combo"
- `AppShell.jsx` — sidebar button label "Browse Superconcepts" (was "Browse Combos"), tab labels for combo tabs, context menu items
- Any other component that renders the word "combo" to users (search through codebase for user-facing strings)

**Architecture Decisions:** #243 (superconcepts are a UI rename only — all internal identifiers remain "combo")

---

#### Phase 42b: Document Coauthor Invite by Username/ORCID — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Add username/ORCID search to document coauthor invitations, mirroring the Phase 41d corpus invite pattern. Authors can search for and directly add coauthors instead of relying solely on invite links.

**Backend changes:**
- New `POST /api/corpuses/documents/:documentId/invite-author` — in `corpusController.js`. Author-only (uploader or existing coauthor, checked via `isDocumentAuthor` with root document resolution). Body: `{ userId }`. Validation chain: document exists (404), target user exists (404), caller is an author (403), target is not already an author — check both `uploaded_by` on root doc and `document_authors` table (409). Inserts into `document_authors` with root document ID. Returns `{ success: true, user: { id, username, orcidId } }`.
- Reuses existing `GET /api/users/search` endpoint (Phase 41d) — no new search endpoint needed.

**Frontend changes:**
- `api.js` — new `corpusAPI.inviteAuthorToDocument(documentId, userId)` method
- `CorpusTabContent.jsx` — in the coauthor management section (where invite link generation and coauthor list already live), added "Add coauthor" search input between the coauthor warning and the invite link UI. Author-only visibility. Same UX as `CorpusMembersPanel`: text input with placeholder "Search by username or ORCID", debounced 300ms with `useRef` timer, min 2 chars. Dropdown results show username + OrcidBadge + "Add" button. On success: "Added ✓" feedback (1.5s), then auto-clears input/results and refreshes coauthor list. On 409: "Already a coauthor". Same `onMouseDown`/`blurTimerRef` pattern to handle focus/blur.

**Architecture Decisions:** #244 (document coauthor direct add mirrors corpus pattern from Phase 41d)

---

#### Phase 42c: Superconcept Ownership Transfer — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Superconcept owners can transfer ownership to any other user via username/ORCID search. Account deletion requires transferring all owned superconcepts first (matching the corpus pattern).

**Backend changes:**
- New `POST /api/combos/:id/transfer-ownership` — in `comboController.js`. Owner-only. Body: `{ newOwnerId }`. Validation: combo exists (404), caller is owner (403), target user exists (404), target is not already the owner (400). Updates `combos.created_by` to the new owner. If the new owner is not already a subscriber, auto-subscribes them (insert into `combo_subscriptions` + `sidebar_items`). Returns `{ success: true }`.
- Update `POST /api/auth/delete-account` — add pre-check: user must own zero combos in addition to zero corpuses. Returns 400 with message indicating which combos need to be transferred. Query: `SELECT id, name FROM combos WHERE created_by = $1`.

**Frontend changes:**
- `ComboTabContent.jsx` — new "Transfer ownership" section (owner-only), below the existing owner info area. Username/ORCID search input (same pattern as 42b), with a "Transfer" button on each result. Confirmation step: "Transfer ownership of [superconcept name] to [username]?" with Confirm/Cancel. On success: refresh combo data (owner display updates), current user loses owner controls.
- Account deletion UI — update the pre-deletion check message to mention both corpuses and superconcepts that need to be transferred.

**Architecture Decisions:** #245 (transfer target is any user, not just subscribers), #246 (auto-subscribe new owner), #247 (account deletion requires zero owned superconcepts — updates Architecture Decision #225)

---

#### Phase 42d: Corpus Member Document Removal — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Corpus members (users in `corpus_allowed_users`) can remove documents they personally added to the corpus. Owners retain the ability to remove any document. Members cannot remove documents added by other members or by the owner.

**Backend changes:**
- Update `POST /api/corpuses/:id/documents/remove` — expand permission check. Currently owner-only. New logic:
  1. If caller is the corpus owner → allow removal of any document (unchanged)
  2. If caller is a corpus member (in `corpus_allowed_users`) → allow removal only if `corpus_documents.added_by = req.user.userId` for this specific corpus-document link
  3. Otherwise → 403
- Same orphan cleanup behavior applies regardless of who removes the document (auto-delete if document is in zero corpuses, unless uploaded by an allowed user of the former corpus — orphan rescue per Phase 9b)

**Frontend changes:**
- `CorpusTabContent.jsx` and/or `CorpusDocumentList.jsx` — show a remove/✕ button on documents where the current user is either: (a) the corpus owner, or (b) the `added_by` user for that document. This requires the document list API to return `added_by` information (or at minimum an `isRemovableByCurrentUser` flag). Check whether the existing document list response already includes `added_by` — if not, add it.
- Confirmation dialog before removal (same pattern as existing owner removal)

**Architecture Decisions:** #248 (corpus members can remove their own documents — permission expansion on existing endpoint, same orphan cleanup behavior)

---

#### Phase 42 Implementation Priority

1. ~~**42a** (Rename combos → superconcepts in UI)~~ ✅
2. ~~**42b** (Document coauthor invite by username/ORCID)~~ ✅
3. ~~**42c** (Superconcept ownership transfer + account deletion pre-check)~~ ✅
4. ~~**42d** (Corpus member document removal)~~ ✅

---

### Phase 43: Tunneling — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Let users create cross-graph, cross-attribute links between specific edges (concepts-in-context). Tunnel links are bidirectional (creating A→B also creates B→A), edge-level, permanent (append-only), and votable independently in each direction. The tunnel view shows linked concepts organized into vertical columns by attribute, with per-column search/add and sorting.

**Key distinction from existing features:**
- **Flip View** shows all parent contexts where the *same concept* appears — it requires a shared concept name. Tunnel links connect *different* concepts across graphs.
- **Superconcepts** group edges into named collections to collate annotations. Tunnel links are direct pairwise connections visible from each concept's own page.
- **Tunneling** says "this specific edge is meaningfully connected to that specific edge" — a direct, permanent, votable assertion of cross-graph relevance.

**Completed:** All three sub-phases implemented and verified.

---

#### Phase 43a: Backend Infrastructure — Tables, Endpoints, Search Attribute Filter — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** High

**New database tables:** `tunnel_links`, `tunnel_votes` (see Database Schema section for full schemas).

**New API endpoints (`/api/tunnels`):**

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/:edgeId` | Guest OK | Get all tunnel links for an edge, grouped by attribute. Returns linked concept name, path, attribute, save vote count on destination edge, tunnel vote count, user_voted. Supports `?sort=votes\|new` (default: votes). |
| POST | `/create` | Required | Create a tunnel link. Body: `{ originEdgeId, linkedEdgeId }`. Inserts two rows (bidirectional). Auto-votes both directions for creator. Returns 409 if link already exists. Validates both edges exist, are different, and are not the same edge. |
| POST | `/vote` | Required | Toggle vote on a tunnel link. Body: `{ tunnelLinkId }`. Inserts if not voted, deletes if already voted. Returns `{ voted, voteCount }`. |

**Existing endpoint modification:**
- `GET /api/concepts/search` — add optional `?attributeId=N` query parameter to filter results to concepts that have at least one edge with the specified attribute. This enables the per-column search in tunnel view to only return concepts from the correct attribute.

**Backend implementation notes:**
- GET endpoint JOINs through `tunnel_links` → `edges` → `concepts` to return full concept name, path names (via batch concept name lookup), and attribute info
- Save vote count on the destination edge from `COUNT(DISTINCT v.user_id)` on the `votes` table for `linked_edge_id`
- Results grouped by `attributes.id` for the frontend to distribute into columns
- Sort applied per-column on the frontend (backend returns all data, frontend sorts within each attribute group)

**Files:** `migrate.js`, new `tunnelController.js`, new `routes/tunnels.js`, `server.js`, `api.js`, `conceptsController.js` (search attributeId filter)

**Suggested git commit:** `feat: 43a — tunnel backend infrastructure, bidirectional links, voting, search attribute filter`

---

#### Phase 43b: Tunnel View UI — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** High

**New view mode:** `'tunnel'` added to `graph_tabs.view_mode` (alongside `'children'` and `'flip'`).

**Tunnel button in concept header:**
- Appears in children view only (hidden in flip view and tunnel view itself)
- Placed in the header row alongside Flip View toggle, Share, Add as Annotation
- Text label "Tunnel" (matching Zen aesthetic — no emoji)
- Clicking switches to tunnel view mode; back button returns to children view
- Persisted in `graph_tabs.view_mode`

**Tunnel view layout (replaces both columns — full width, no annotation panel):**

- **Column container:** Horizontal flex with one column per enabled attribute (from `ENABLED_ATTRIBUTES` env var — currently action, tool, value, question). The current concept's own attribute gets a column too (tunneling to other concepts of the same attribute is valid).
- **Each column:**
  - Column header: attribute name (e.g., "action", "tool", "value", "question")
  - Search/add field at top of column (filters to that attribute via `?attributeId=N`). Same surfacing of save votes/corpus badges as existing SearchField.
  - When user selects a concept from search, show a context picker (all parent edges for that concept with that attribute) — same pattern as AnnotationPanel context picker
  - After selecting an edge, the tunnel link is created (both directions), auto-voted, and the card appears in the column
  - Per-column sort toggle: "Votes | New" (flat horizontal toggle)
  - Scrollable card list below search field

- **Concept cards in each column (one per row, full column width):**
  - Concept name (clickable — navigates current graph tab to that concept in its context)
  - Full path displayed below the name (root → ... → parent, same path rendering as flip view cards)
  - Tunnel vote count with clickable ▲ toggle (same pattern as flip view link votes)
  - Small read-only save vote count on the destination edge (lighter/smaller text)
  - Right-click context menu: "Open in new graph tab"

- **Responsive behavior:** Below 900px, columns switch to horizontal scroll (`overflow-x: auto`) rather than stacking vertically.

- **Empty column state:** "No tunnels yet" with the search field still active at top

**Additional changes bundled in this sub-phase:**

**Right-click "Open in new graph tab" on Flip View cards:**
- FlipView concept cards currently navigate on click (Phase 38a behavior)
- Add right-click context menu with "Open in new graph tab" option
- Uses existing `handleOpenConceptTab` pattern to create a fresh graph tab

**Flip View sort label rename:**
- In `FlipView.jsx`, change the first sort toggle label from "Links" to "Votes" in the `Links | Similarity ↓ | Similarity ↑` toggle. No functional change — just the label text for the `similarity_votes` link vote count sort.

**Files:** `Concept.jsx` (tunnel button, view mode switching), new `TunnelView.jsx`, `FlipView.jsx` (right-click context menu, sort label rename), `AppShell.jsx` (graph tab view_mode handling for 'tunnel'), `api.js`

**Suggested git commit:** `feat: 43b — tunnel view UI with per-attribute columns, search/add, voting, right-click new tab, flip view sort label rename`

---

#### Phase 43c: Polish & Edge Cases — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** Low-Medium

**Tasks completed:**
- Guest access verified: tunnel button visible, search/create hidden, vote buttons read-only, card navigation works, right-click "Open in new graph tab" works via ephemeral guest tabs
- Hidden edges verified: tunnel links TO hidden edges display (Architecture Decision #222), creating tunnels to hidden edges returns 400, navigation layer blocks FROM hidden edges naturally
- `'tunnel'` view mode persists in `graph_tabs` table across refresh/logout (VARCHAR column, no migration needed)
- Root edge tunnel destinations display correctly (empty path, just concept name)
- Context picker skips single-edge concepts (direct creation)
- Fixed: `handleOpenNewTab` was passing path as comma-joined string instead of array (caused path loss when opening new graph tabs from tunnel/flip view right-click)
- Fixed: TunnelView right-click context menu used full-screen overlay that blocked dismiss-on-click-away (removed overlay, matching FlipView pattern)
- Frontend build verification (`npm run build`) — zero errors

---

#### Phase 43 Architecture Decisions

- **Architecture Decision #249 — Tunnel Links Are Bidirectional, Votes Are Directional (Phase 43):** Creating a tunnel link between edges A and B inserts two `tunnel_links` rows (A→B and B→A) in a single transaction. Both directions are visible immediately. However, votes are independent per direction — voting for B in A's tunnel view does not add a vote for A in B's tunnel view. This allows communities to express asymmetric relevance (e.g., "Machine Learning is highly relevant to Statistics" may have more votes than "Statistics is highly relevant to Machine Learning").

- **Architecture Decision #250 — Tunnel Links Are Edge-Level, Not Concept-Level (Phase 43):** Tunnel links connect specific edges (concept-in-context), not concept names globally. "Microscopy [tool]" under `Lab Techniques` and "Microscopy [tool]" under `Imaging Methods` are different contextual entities with independent tunnel link sets. This is consistent with Orca's core principle that identity is determined by path + attribute.

- **Architecture Decision #251 — Tunnel View Uses Full Width, No Annotation Panel (Phase 43):** The tunnel view replaces both the left column (children/flip) and the right column (ConceptAnnotationPanel) with a full-width multi-column layout. This gives each attribute column enough horizontal space for readable concept cards. The annotation panel returns when the user switches back to children or flip view.

- **Architecture Decision #252 — Per-Column Sort in Tunnel View (Phase 43):** Each attribute column in the tunnel view has its own independent sort toggle (Votes | New). This allows users to sort one attribute's tunnels by votes while exploring another attribute's newest additions.

- **Architecture Decision #253 — Tunnel Search Filters by Attribute (Phase 43):** The concept search endpoint gains an optional `?attributeId=N` parameter for tunnel view. Each column's search field only returns concepts that have edges with the matching attribute, preventing users from accidentally trying to tunnel to a concept that doesn't exist in that attribute context.

- **Architecture Decision #254 — Root Edge Tunnel Destinations Require Separate Query (Phase 43c):** The `getConceptParents` endpoint uses `JOIN concepts c ON e.parent_id = c.id` which excludes root edges (where `parent_id IS NULL`). When the tunnel view's context picker resolves edges for a concept, it queries both `getConceptParents` (for non-root edges) and `getRootConcepts` (to find root edges). Root edges matching the column's attribute are merged into the context list. This parallels how AnnotationPanel handles root edges (Architecture Decision #76).

- **Architecture Decision #255 — Flip View Sort Label "Links" Renamed to "Votes" (Phase 43b):** The first sort toggle label in FlipView's contextual sort bar was changed from "Links" to "Votes" for clarity. The underlying sort key (`'links'`) and behavior (sorts by `link_count` descending) are unchanged — only the display label changed.

#### Phase 43 Verification Checklist
1. Create a tunnel link — both directions appear immediately
2. Tunnel link shows in both concepts' tunnel views
3. Voting on direction A→B does not affect B→A vote count
4. Auto-vote on creation applies to both directions
5. Duplicate tunnel link returns 409
6. Search within a column only returns concepts with matching attribute
7. Context picker appears after concept selection (for edge choice)
8. Per-column sort toggles work independently (Votes | New)
9. Concept card click navigates current tab to that concept
10. Right-click "Open in new graph tab" works in tunnel view
11. Right-click "Open in new graph tab" works in flip view
12. Flip view sort label reads "Votes" instead of "Links"
13. Tunnel view is full-width (no annotation panel)
14. Responsive: horizontal scroll on narrow screens
15. Guest users see tunnel links read-only, no create/vote UI
16. Tunnel view mode persists in graph tab across refresh
17. Nav history: back button returns from tunnel to children view
18. Hidden destination edges still show tunnel links
19. Clean build: `cd frontend && npm run build` succeeds

### Phase 44: Sibling-Only Swap Votes & Auto-Save on Swap — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Reverse the Phase 38c expansion of swap votes to any concept-in-context. Restore the original sibling-only restriction (now that tunneling, Phase 43, handles cross-context "this concept belongs elsewhere" expression). Additionally, make swap votes constructive by auto-saving the destination edge — a swap vote A→B becomes both a vote against A *and* a vote for B at this exact spot.

**Motivation:** Phase 38c's expanded swap votes always sat uneasily with Orca's path+attribute identity principle — swapping a concept for a non-sibling implicitly asserted a relationship across contexts that the data model didn't really support. Tunneling (Phase 43) is the proper primitive for cross-context relevance. With tunneling in place, swap votes can return to their original tighter scope: "this sibling is a better fit at this exact spot." Auto-saving the destination converts swaps from a pure negative signal into a constructive endorsement.

---

#### Phase 44a: Backend — Sibling Validation, Auto-Save, New Endpoint Shape — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** Medium

**Tasks:**

**1. Re-add sibling validation to `addSwapVote` (`votesController.js`):**
- Before inserting the `replace_votes` row, fetch both edges and verify:
  - For non-root: `source.parent_id = replacement.parent_id AND source.graph_path = replacement.graph_path`
  - For root edges: `source.parent_id IS NULL AND replacement.parent_id IS NULL AND source.attribute_id = replacement.attribute_id`
- Note: Because each edge has exactly one `attribute_id` and siblings share a parent edge, sibling edges inherently share the same attribute. No separate attribute check is needed for the non-root case.
- Return `400 Bad Request` with message `"Replacement must be a sibling"` if validation fails.

**2. Auto-save the destination on swap (`votesController.js`):**
- After the `replace_votes` insert succeeds, check if the user already has a save vote on `replacement_edge_id` (`SELECT 1 FROM votes WHERE user_id = $1 AND edge_id = $2`).
- If no existing save, call the existing `addVote` logic to insert one. This ensures Phase 20c mutual-exclusivity cascades run normally (e.g., if the user had a swap vote on the destination, it gets cleared by the new save).
- Wrap the `replace_votes` insert and the auto-save in a single transaction (`BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`) so we don't end up with a swap vote without its auto-save (or vice versa) if one operation fails.
- Return `autoSaved: true|false` in the response so the frontend can show the inline "Also added a vote for [name]" message.

**3. Reshape `GET /swap/:edgeId` response (`votesController.js`):**
- Current response: `{ swapVotes: [...], totalSwapVotes }` — flat list of replacement edges with vote counts.
- New response: `{ existingSwaps: [...], otherSiblings: [...], totalSwapVotes }`.
- **`existingSwaps`** — Concepts that already have ≥1 swap vote at this edge. Each item: `{ replacementEdgeId, replacementChildId, replacementName, voteCount, userVoted, saveCount }`. Sorted by `voteCount DESC`.
- **`otherSiblings`** — Sibling edges of `edgeId` that have NOT received any swap vote from this edge. Each item: `{ edgeId, childId, childName, saveCount }`. Sorted by `saveCount DESC`.
- A sibling already in `existingSwaps` must NOT also appear in `otherSiblings`.
- Drop `replacementAttributeId`, `replacementAttributeName`, and any parent path data — the modal no longer displays these because all results share the same context.
- For the root case, "siblings" are all root edges with the same `attribute_id` as the source.

**4. `removeSwapVote` is unchanged.** Removing a swap does NOT remove the auto-saved destination. See Architecture Decision #258.

**5. Pre-launch test data cleanup:**
- Write a one-time migration script `migrations/044_cleanup_cross_context_swaps.sql` that **deletes** existing `replace_votes` rows where the source and replacement are not siblings under the new rule.
- Since this is pre-launch test data, deletion (not soft-hide) is fine and avoids any need for filter logic in the new queries. The append-only philosophy applies to production data only.
- Suggested SQL: delete rows where `source.parent_id IS DISTINCT FROM replacement.parent_id OR source.graph_path IS DISTINCT FROM replacement.graph_path` (with the root case handled by the `IS DISTINCT FROM` semantics of NULL parent_ids matching).
- Verify the cleanup with a `SELECT COUNT(*)` before and after.

**Files:** `votesController.js`, `migrations/044_cleanup_cross_context_swaps.sql`

**Suggested git commit:** `feat: 44a — sibling-only swap validation, auto-save destination, new GET /swap response shape`

---

#### Phase 44b: Frontend — SwapModal UI Redesign — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** Medium

**Tasks:**

**1. Update `api.js`:**
- The existing `getSwapVotes(edgeId)` call now returns the new shape `{ existingSwaps, otherSiblings, totalSwapVotes }`. Update any TypeScript-style JSDoc comments if present.
- The existing `addSwapVote` response now includes `autoSaved: boolean`.

**2. Redesign `SwapModal.jsx`:**

**Layout:**
- **Section 1: "Existing swap votes"** — only rendered if `existingSwaps.length > 0`. Header: `Existing swap votes`. Cards listed in the order returned (already sorted by vote count desc).
- **Section 2: "Other siblings"** — always rendered (unless there are no siblings at all, in which case show "No other siblings"). Header: `Other siblings`. A small inline search input sits directly below the header label, above the card list. Cards listed in the order returned (already sorted by save count desc).

**Card design (both sections — simplified from current):**
- Concept name on the left (single line, EB Garamond, no italics)
- Save count next to the name as a small neutral label, e.g. `▲ 12 votes`
- Vote button on the right with the standard arrow + count format: `▲ N` where N is the swap vote count for this destination from this source edge
- The vote button shading matches the existing save vote button pattern: dark filled background when `userVoted === true`, transparent with border otherwise
- For "Other siblings" cards, the swap vote count is always 0 and the button is unshaded — clicking it casts the first swap vote (and triggers the auto-save)
- **Removed from cards (compared to Phase 38c version):** parent path text, attribute badge, "open in new graph tab" link/button

**Search field:**
- Placed above the "Other siblings" list only (not above "Existing swap votes")
- Plain text input with placeholder `Search siblings...`
- Client-side filter: `sibling.childName.toLowerCase().includes(query.trim().toLowerCase())`
- No API call, no fuzzy matching, no debouncing needed
- When the search field is empty, show the full sorted list

**3. Vote action wiring:**
- Clicking a vote button in either section calls `addSwapVote(edgeId, replacementEdgeId)`.
- On success, refetch `getSwapVotes(edgeId)` to repopulate both sections (the voted-for sibling moves from `otherSiblings` to `existingSwaps`).
- If the response includes `autoSaved: true`, display a small inline note below the action area for ~3 seconds: `Also added a vote for [conceptName]`. Use the word "vote" not "save vote" per the user's terminology preference.
- Clicking a shaded vote button (i.e., the user has already voted) calls `removeSwapVote(edgeId, replacementEdgeId)` and refetches. Note that removing the swap does NOT remove the auto-saved destination (Architecture Decision #258).

**4. Update `ConceptGrid.jsx` swap button:**
- The ⇄ button on child cards continues to open the modal as before. No changes needed there — the modal handles the new shape.
- The `swap_count` badge already reflects the new sibling-only count automatically because the cleanup migration removed cross-context rows.

**Files:** `SwapModal.jsx`, `api.js`, possibly `ConceptGrid.jsx` (verify only)

**Suggested git commit:** `feat: 44b — SwapModal UI redesign with siblings-only sections, search, simplified cards, auto-save inline note`

---

#### Phase 44c: Polish, Edge Cases, Verification — ✅ COMPLETE

**Complexity:** Low

**Tasks:**
- **Guest access:** Verify guest users can see both sections in the modal (read-only), with vote buttons hidden or disabled. The auto-save behavior is irrelevant for guests since they cannot vote.
- **Empty states:**
  - No existing swap votes + no other siblings → modal shows `No siblings to swap with`
  - No existing swap votes + some siblings → "Existing swap votes" section is hidden, only "Other siblings" shows
  - Some existing swaps + no remaining other siblings → "Other siblings" section shows `No other siblings` (or hides entirely)
- **Self-swap prevention:** The source edge itself must never appear in the `otherSiblings` list. Backend already filters this via the `WHERE id != $edgeId` condition; verify with a test.
- **Root edge swaps:** Verify Phase 38b root swap behavior still works — root concepts can swap with other root concepts of the same attribute. The modal opens from the ⇄ button on root concept cards in `Root.jsx`.
- **Auto-save cascade interaction:** If user swaps A→B and B already had an active swap vote from this user (B→C), the auto-save on B should cascade-clear that swap (Phase 20c mutual exclusivity). Test this scenario explicitly.
- **Auto-save persistence on swap removal:** Cast swap A→B (auto-saves B), then remove the swap. Verify B is still saved.
- **Search field behavior:** Empty search shows full list; typing filters in real time; clearing the search restores the full list.
- **Frontend build verification:** `cd frontend && npm run build` — zero errors.
- **Backend smoke tests via curl:** Add swap, verify auto-save, get swap response shape, remove swap, verify save persists.

**Files:** `SwapModal.jsx`, `votesController.js` (bug fixes only)

**Suggested git commit:** `fix: 44c — swap modal polish, edge cases, verification`

---

#### Phase 44 Architecture Decisions

- **Architecture Decision #256 — Swap Votes Re-Restricted to Siblings (Phase 44):** Reverses Architecture Decision #216 (Phase 38c). Swap votes now require the replacement edge to be a sibling — same `parent_id` and `graph_path` (and for root edges, both must be root with the same `attribute_id`). Cross-context "this concept belongs elsewhere" expression is now handled exclusively by tunneling (Phase 43), which is the better primitive for cross-graph relationships. Pre-launch `replace_votes` rows that violated the new sibling rule were deleted in a one-time cleanup migration (`044_cleanup_cross_context_swaps.sql`) — acceptable because this is test data; production rollout post-launch will not face this issue.

- **Architecture Decision #257 — Swap Votes Auto-Save the Destination (Phase 44):** Casting a swap vote A→B automatically inserts a save vote on B if the user has not already saved B. This converts swap votes from a pure negative signal ("replace A") into a constructive endorsement ("B belongs here instead of A"). The auto-save runs through the existing `addVote` code path so Phase 20c mutual-exclusivity cascades apply normally — for example, if the user previously had a swap vote on B itself, the new save on B will clear that swap. The two operations (swap insert + auto-save) are wrapped in a single transaction to prevent partial state.

- **Architecture Decision #258 — Removing a Swap Does Not Remove the Auto-Save (Phase 44):** The auto-save on swap creation is a one-time nudge. If a user later removes the swap vote A→B, the save vote on B is preserved — the user must manually unsave B if they want it gone. Rationale: removing the swap may mean "I changed my mind about A being bad" without implying "I no longer think B is good." Automatic save removal would create surprising state changes and conflict with the principle that user actions should be deliberate and visible.

#### Phase 44 Verification Checklist

1. Cast a swap vote between two siblings — succeeds, swap vote count increments
2. Cast a swap vote between non-siblings — backend returns 400 "Replacement must be a sibling"
3. Cast a swap vote A→B where the user has not saved B — verify B now has a save vote from this user
4. Cast a swap vote A→B where the user already saved B — verify no duplicate save row inserted (`autoSaved: false` in response)
5. Cast a swap vote A→B where the user previously swap-voted B→C — verify the auto-save on B cascade-clears the B→C swap (Phase 20c)
6. Remove a swap vote A→B (where B was auto-saved) — verify the save on B persists
7. Modal opens with "Existing swap votes" section sorted by vote count descending
8. Modal opens with "Other siblings" section sorted by save count descending
9. A sibling that has any swap vote appears only in "Existing swap votes", not in "Other siblings"
10. Search field above "Other siblings" filters in real time; case-insensitive substring match
11. Vote button shading matches save vote button pattern (dark filled when voted, transparent with border otherwise)
12. Auto-save inline note `Also added a vote for [name]` appears for ~3 seconds when applicable
13. Cards do NOT display parent path, attribute badge, or open-in-new-tab link
14. Cards DO display the destination's save count (e.g., `▲ 12 votes`)
15. Root concept swap votes still work (Phase 38b regression check) — ⇄ button on root cards opens modal with other root siblings of the same attribute
16. Self-swap is impossible — source edge never appears in `otherSiblings`
17. Guest users can view the modal read-only; vote buttons hidden or disabled
18. Cleanup migration deleted any pre-existing cross-context swap rows; swap_count badges on child cards now reflect the cleaned-up data
19. Clean build: `cd frontend && npm run build` succeeds
20. ConceptGrid ⇄ button still opens modal; `swap_count` badge and `user_swapped` styling still work

#### Phase 44 Implementation Priority

1. ~~**44a** — Backend sibling validation, auto-save transaction, new GET response shape, cleanup migration~~ ✅
2. ~~**44b** — SwapModal UI redesign with two sections, search, simplified cards, auto-save inline note~~ ✅
3. ~~**44c** — Polish, edge cases (root swaps, cascades, empty states), verification~~ ✅

### Phase 45: Annotation Creation Warning Modal — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Add a confirmation modal that warns users annotations are permanent before creating one. Includes a "Don't show this again" checkbox with per-user database persistence.

**Implementation:**
- New `hide_annotation_warning BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false` column on `users` table
- New `POST /api/auth/hide-annotation-warning` endpoint (sets column to `true`)
- `GET /api/auth/me` now returns `hideAnnotationWarning` field
- New `AnnotationWarningModal.jsx` component — title "Annotations are permanent", explains append-only model, "Don't show again" checkbox, Cancel/Create buttons
- Wired into `AnnotationPanel.jsx` — the single code path for annotation creation (`handleConfirmCreate`). If `user.hideAnnotationWarning === true`, skips modal and creates directly. Otherwise shows modal; on confirm with checkbox checked, calls the dismissal endpoint and `refreshUser()` to update auth context in-session.
- Guests cannot create annotations (existing guards), so the modal never appears for them.

**Architecture Decision #259 — Annotation Warning Stored Per-User in Database (Phase 45):** The "don't show again" preference is stored in the `users` table rather than `localStorage` because researchers log in from multiple devices. Database storage ensures the preference follows the user everywhere.

---

### Phase 46: Responsive Concept Header Layout — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Fix the concept header squishing at half-screen widths by making it reflow gracefully.

**Strategy:** `flexWrap: 'wrap'` on three style objects in `Concept.jsx`:
- `headerContent` — breadcrumb row with action buttons. Buttons wrap below breadcrumb at narrow widths.
- `buttonSection` — action buttons (Flip View, Share, Tunnel, Add as Annotation, Add to Superconcept). Individual buttons wrap within the group.
- `conceptHeader` — concept name + vote count + sort toggles. Sort toggles wrap below the name.

**Why flex-wrap over stacked breakpoint:** The header has a moderate number of buttons — wrapping looks clean. No JavaScript resize listener needed; pure CSS flex property with zero visual effect at full desktop width (no regression).

---

### Phase 47: Superconcepts Tab in Concept Annotation Panel — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Show which superconcepts (combos) contain the current edge in the concept annotation panel, with click-through navigation to the superconcept tab. Also make subconcept names clickable in the superconcept tab for all users.

**Backend:**
- New `GET /api/combos/by-edge/:edgeId` — guest-accessible via `optionalAuth`. JOINs `combo_edges` to find combos containing the specified edge. Returns array of combos with id, name, description, `created_by_username`, `created_by_orcid_id`, `edge_count`, `annotation_count`, `subscriber_count`. Sorted by `subscriber_count DESC, name ASC`. Returns `[]` for edges in zero combos. Validates edgeId is a positive integer (400 on invalid). Uses LEFT JOIN users for ownerless combo support.

**Frontend — ConceptAnnotationPanel:**
- New conditional "Superconcepts (N)" tab after Web Links tab. Only renders when N > 0.
- Superconcepts fetched in a separate useEffect (children view with valid edgeId only). Uses `.catch(() => [])` fallback to avoid cascading failures.
- Auto-fallback effect: if active tab is `'superconcepts'` and count drops to 0, switches back to `'annotations'`.
- Each card shows: clickable name, owner with OrcidBadge, truncated description (2-line clamp), stats line with proper singular/plural.
- Clicking a card calls `onNavigateToSuperconcept(id, name)` which subscribes and opens the superconcept tab directly (same pattern as corpus auto-subscribe).

**Frontend — ComboTabContent:**
- Subconcept list moved out of the `isOwner` block — now visible to all users.
- Subconcept names are clickable for everyone, opening a new graph tab via `onOpenConceptTab(conceptId, graphPath, conceptName, attributeName)`.
- Owner-only controls (+ Add Concept button, ✕ remove buttons) remain gated by `isOwner`.

**Architecture Decision #260 — Superconcept Tab Is Edge-Scoped, Not Cross-Context (Phase 47):** The "Superconcepts" tab in ConceptAnnotationPanel only appears in children view (where there's a single current edge), not in flip view or tunnel view. This matches the data model — combo membership is per-edge, not per-concept. Different edges for the same concept may belong to different combos.

**Architecture Decision #261 — Superconcept Click-Through Subscribes Directly (Phase 47):** Clicking a superconcept card in the annotation panel auto-subscribes and switches to the superconcept tab (same pattern as annotation card click-through for corpuses). This is more direct than opening the Browse Superconcepts overlay and having the user manually subscribe.

---

### Phase 49: Rate Limiting Hardening — ✅ 49a/49b COMPLETE

**Goal:** Close the rate-limiting gaps identified in `RATE_LIMIT_AUDIT.md`. The existing IP-only limiters in `auth.js` were effectively broken in production because trust proxy was not configured, and every write endpoint outside of auth had zero rate limiting. Twilio SMS abuse was the primary concern.

#### Phase 49a: Foundation (trust proxy + SMS abuse protection) — ✅ COMPLETE

**Trust proxy:** `app.set('trust proxy', 2)` in `server.js` before any route or limiter mounts. Set to `2` because production traffic passes through Cloudflare → Railway (two hops). Without this, `req.ip` resolved to the proxy's IP and every IP-keyed limiter collapsed into a single global bucket. Also silences the `express-rate-limit` v8 startup validation warning.

**Postgres-backed rate limit store:** New `backend/src/utils/pgRateLimitStore.js` and `rate_limit_counters` table (key, window_start, count). Fixed-window bucketing keyed to `floor(now / windowMs) * windowMs`. Atomic increments via `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`. Opportunistic cleanup of rows older than 7 days on every increment (non-blocking). Exports `increment`, `getCount`, `getCountSince`, `currentWindowStart`. Used for limiters where counter persistence across deploys matters — currently only the SMS abuse limits.

**Per-phone SMS limiter:** Keyed on the `phone_lookup` HMAC, not IP. Two buckets: 2 SMS/hour/phone, 5 SMS/24hr/phone. Implemented inside the controller (not as Express middleware) because the phone_lookup hash isn't computed until after the request body parsing and phone normalization. `checkSmsRateLimits()` runs BEFORE calling Twilio; `recordSmsSend()` runs AFTER a successful Twilio response so that failed sends do not eat into the user's quota. Applied to both `POST /auth/send-code` (registration) and `POST /auth/forgot-password/send-code`.

**Global daily SMS cap:** 200 SMS/24hr across both send-code endpoints, keyed on the fixed string `sms:global`. Returns 503 "Verification is temporarily unavailable" with a loud `[SMS CAP]` log line when breached. This is the blast-radius bound — worst case, a total bypass of per-phone/per-IP protections is still capped at ~200 Twilio messages per day.

**Retired limiter:** The old `sendCodeLimiter` (in-memory, IP-keyed, 5/15min) is deleted. Comments in `routes/auth.js` point to the new controller-level limits. `loginLimiter` and `verifyCodeLimiter` remain — they are still IP-keyed but now correct because trust proxy is configured.

**Fail-open on store errors:** If the Postgres store throws during `checkSmsRateLimits`, the controller logs the error and allows the request through. The rationale is that Twilio spending is still backstopped by the Twilio console spend cap (an out-of-code defense documented in PRELAUNCH.md), and failing closed on a database hiccup would lock legitimate users out of registration/password reset.

#### Phase 49b: Write-endpoint limiters + global safety net — ✅ COMPLETE

**Per-user hourly limiter factory:** New `backend/src/utils/userRateLimiter.js`. Exports a `perUserHourly(max, label)` factory plus ten pre-configured limiters. Keyed by `req.user.userId` (NOT IP) via a custom `keyGenerator`. Uses `express-rate-limit`'s default in-memory store — persistent storage is unnecessary here because these limits bound damage rather than dollar cost, and a counter reset on deploy just clears the attacker's counter (minor inconvenience at most). SMS limits are the ones that must survive deploys.

**Why user-keyed, not IP-keyed:** An authenticated attacker has already proven they can create accounts, so IP limits just push them to use a second account. Legitimate users behind NAT/proxy share an IP and should have independent budgets. JWT auth is required for all these endpoints anyway, so `req.user.userId` is always present by the time the limiter runs.

**Critical: limiters must be mounted AFTER `authenticateToken`** so `req.user.userId` is populated by the time `keyGenerator` fires. The factory has no IP fallback — if an unauthenticated request ever reached the limiter it would throw, which is preferable to silently IP-keying (and would also trip `express-rate-limit` v8's IPv6-safety validation, which was the cause of a startup-warning spam during initial implementation).

**Applied to 10 write endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Limit | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/moderation/flag` | 20/hr | Weaponizable — 10 flags hides an edge |
| `POST /api/corpuses/annotations/create` | 60/hr | Annotations are permanent and public |
| `POST /api/corpuses/:id/documents/upload` | 10/hr | R2 storage + PDF/DOCX extraction CPU |
| `POST /api/corpuses/versions/create` | 10/hr | Same cost profile as uploads |
| `POST /api/pages/:slug/comments` | 10/hr | Public-facing spam target |
| `POST /api/messages/threads/create` | 20/hr | Unsolicited-message vector |
| `POST /api/messages/threads/:id/reply` | 120/hr | Replies are mutual, higher budget |
| `POST /api/votes/web-links/add` | 30/hr | Attractive to link spammers |
| `POST /api/concepts/root` | 10/hr | Graph-level vandalism |
| `POST /api/concepts/child` | 100/hr | Normal usage budget |

**Global safety-net limiter:** `server.js` originally mounted a 500 req / 15 min / IP limiter (in-memory, express-rate-limit) on `/api` BEFORE any routes. This was replaced in Phase 49d — see below — after the original threshold locked the owner out during routine dev use.

**Verification:** Smoke-tested the flag limiter end-to-end — requests 1–20 returned 404 (dummy edge ID), request 21 returned 429 with `Retry-After: 3587` (~1 hour). Confirms per-user keying, rate-limit enforcement, and `standardHeaders` all work correctly. Frontend build passes; backend starts cleanly with no `express-rate-limit` v8 validation warnings.

#### Phase 49d: Global safety net — raised threshold, GET-exempt, Postgres-backed — ✅ COMPLETE

**Problem discovered April 11, 2026:** The Phase 49b global safety net (500 req / 15 min / IP, in-memory) was too aggressive for legitimate browsing. React StrictMode double-invokes effects in dev, doubling every API call, so a normal session opening Orca and navigating a few graphs easily exceeded 500 requests in 15 minutes. A university lab behind a NAT'd IP would trip it almost instantly with multiple users. the maintainer locked themselves out during a favicon work session — `taskkill /f /im node.exe` cleared it instantly, confirming the store was in-memory (no Postgres persistence) and counters silently reset on every backend restart in production.

**Fixes in `server.js`:**
- **Threshold raised to 2000 req / 15 min / IP.** Deliberately generous; this is not the primary defense for any specific endpoint, it's a blanket floor.
- **GET requests exempted entirely.** A safety net for abuse should care about writes (creating concepts, voting, flagging, uploading) and auth attempts, not innocent page loads. `skip: (req) => req.method === 'GET'` equivalent is a simple early-return in the middleware.
- **Moved from express-rate-limit in-memory store to Postgres via `pgRateLimitStore`.** Counters now survive backend restarts and are shared across multi-instance deploys. The existing `rate_limit_counters` table is reused with a distinct key namespace `global:ip:<ip>` so it does not collide with the `sms:*` keys used by the SMS abuse limiter.
- **Fail-open on store errors.** A transient database hiccup should not lock legitimate users out of the app. The per-route write-endpoint limiters (Phase 49b) and the per-phone SMS limiter (Phase 49a) are the real defenses; this is a backstop.
- Custom async middleware (not express-rate-limit middleware) because the express-rate-limit Store interface would require writing a full adapter around `pgRateLimitStore`, and the existing store helpers already expose exactly what's needed (`increment`, `currentWindowStart`).
- Sets `RateLimit-Limit`, `RateLimit-Remaining`, `RateLimit-Reset` headers on all non-GET responses (standardHeaders-equivalent); adds `Retry-After` on 429s. Legacy `X-RateLimit-*` headers intentionally omitted.

**Verification:**
- `node -c src/server.js` — syntax OK.
- Backend boots cleanly, no startup errors.
- 20 bursts of `GET /api/concepts/root` — all 200, zero RateLimit headers (correctly exempt).
- POST to a 404 route — produces `RateLimit-Limit: 2000`, `RateLimit-Remaining: 1993`, `RateLimit-Reset: <seconds until next window>`.
- `rate_limit_counters` row written with key `global:ip:::1` incrementing from 1 → 6 across 6 POST requests.
- Injected `count = 2001` into the counter row by hand — next POST returns `429` with JSON error body and `Retry-After` header; GET simultaneously still returns 200 (exempt path unaffected).
- Per-user write-endpoint limiters (Phase 49b) untouched — only `server.js` modified.

#### Phase 49c: Polish (post-launch, not yet implemented)

- Frontend 429 handling: parse `RateLimit-Reset` header, disable the submit button, show a countdown (start with `LoginModal.jsx`).
- Per-account login lockout: 5 failed attempts on same identifier → 15 min lock (mitigates credential stuffing).
- Move `loginLimiter` and `verifyCodeLimiter` from in-memory to the Postgres store so they also survive deploys.
- CAPTCHA decision (hCaptcha free tier in front of `sendCode`).

#### Phase 49 Architecture Decisions

- **Architecture Decision #262 — SMS Limiters Live in the Controller, Not Middleware (Phase 49a):** Per-phone SMS limits are checked inside `authController.sendCode` / `forgotPasswordSendCode`, not as Express middleware. The reason is that the `phone_lookup` HMAC isn't computed until after request body parsing and phone normalization — by the time the key is available, the request is already inside the controller. A middleware approach would require duplicating the normalization logic. `checkSmsRateLimits` runs before the Twilio call, `recordSmsSend` runs after success. Failed Twilio sends do not consume quota.

- **Architecture Decision #263 — Rate Limit Store Fails Open (Phase 49a):** If the Postgres rate-limit store throws during `checkSmsRateLimits`, the controller logs and allows the request. Rationale: the Twilio console spend cap is the last-resort dollar-cost backstop, and failing closed on transient database errors would lock legitimate users out of registration and password reset. This is a deliberate availability-over-security tradeoff for one specific failure mode.

- **Architecture Decision #264 — Write Limiters Are User-Keyed, Not IP-Keyed (Phase 49b):** Per-user limiters on write endpoints key on `req.user.userId`, not `req.ip`. An authenticated attacker has already paid the account-creation cost, so IP limits just encourage them to create a second account. Legitimate users behind NAT/proxy share an IP and should have independent budgets. The in-memory store is fine here because these limits bound damage (not dollar cost) and a counter reset on deploy is an acceptable tradeoff.

- **Architecture Decision #265 — No IP Fallback in User Key Generator (Phase 49b):** The `perUserHourly` factory's `keyGenerator` directly accesses `req.user.userId` with no fallback. This is safe because all consuming routes mount the limiter AFTER `authenticateToken`, which guarantees `req.user` is populated. An earlier implementation with an IP fallback tripped `express-rate-limit` v8's IPv6-safety validation and produced startup warning spam. The explicit reliance on `authenticateToken` preceding the limiter is documented in the factory's header comment.

- **Architecture Decision #266 — Trust Proxy Set to 2 (Phase 49a):** `app.set('trust proxy', 2)` reflects production topology — traffic passes through Cloudflare → Railway edge → app, which is two proxy hops. Setting this to `1` would still leak the Cloudflare edge IP as `req.ip`; setting it to `2` walks two headers back to get the actual client IP. Must be set before any route or limiter mounts, or the limiters are created with the wrong key function. This finding was the highest-severity item in `RATE_LIMIT_AUDIT.md` because every pre-Phase-49 rate limiter was effectively broken in production without it.

- **Architecture Decision #267 — Global Safety Net Exempts GETs (Phase 49d):** The global safety-net limiter skips GET requests entirely. Reads should never consume the bucket because a safety net for abuse should care about writes (creating concepts, voting, flagging, uploading) and auth attempts, not innocent page loads. React StrictMode in dev double-invokes effects, so a normal session can rack up 100+ GETs in a few minutes — the pre-Phase-49d threshold of 500 req/15min locked the owner out during routine dev work. Exempting reads means the global bucket only meters state-changing traffic, which is the thing the backstop is meant to bound.

- **Architecture Decision #268 — Global Safety Net Uses Postgres Store (Phase 49d):** The global safety net moved from express-rate-limit's in-memory store to the existing `pgRateLimitStore`, with key namespace `global:ip:<ip>` to avoid collision with the SMS limiter's `sms:*` keys. Rationale: on Railway's multi-instance deploys an in-memory store means counters are not shared across instances and silently reset on every restart, so an abuser's counter clears on any deploy. Postgres gives real persistence shared across instances. The implementation is a custom async middleware rather than a full express-rate-limit Store adapter because `pgRateLimitStore`'s helpers already expose exactly what a manual middleware needs, and writing an adapter would add indirection for no benefit. Fails open on store errors — a transient DB hiccup should not lock legit users out, and the per-route write-endpoint limiters (Phase 49b) plus the per-phone SMS limiter (Phase 49a) are the real defenses.

### Phase 50: Reverse Citations — "Cited by N" on Annotations — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Give every annotation a visible count of how many other documents cite it, and let users expand the annotation to see and click through to those citing documents. Complements Phase 38j (forward citations) by providing the reverse direction — no schema change required since `document_citation_links` already stores `cited_annotation_id` with a covering index.

**Phase 50a: Backend — Reverse Citation Lookup — ✅ COMPLETE**

- New endpoint `GET /api/annotations/:id/cited-by` (guest OK). Lives in `routes/annotations.js` (new file). Queries `document_citation_links` filtered by `cited_annotation_id = $1 AND citing_document_id IS NOT NULL`, joined to `documents`, `users`, `corpus_documents`, and `corpuses` for full citing-document context. Uses LEFT JOIN on users so cascade-deleted uploaders return `uploadedByUsername: null` gracefully.
- Returns `{ citedBy: [{ linkId, citingDocumentId, citingDocumentTitle, citingCorpusId, citingCorpusName, uploadedBy, uploadedByUsername, uploadedByOrcid, createdAt }, ...] }`, ordered `created_at DESC`.
- Invalid ID (non-integer) returns 400. Non-existent ID returns 200 with empty array (matches forward `/documents/:id/citations` pattern).
- `cited_by_count` (snake_case) / `citedByCount` (camelCase) added to six annotation-returning endpoints: `getDocumentAnnotations`, `getAllDocumentAnnotations`, `getAnnotationsForEdge`, `getConceptAnnotations`, `getAnnotationsForConceptOnDocument`, `getComboAnnotations`. Computed via LEFT JOIN aggregate subquery to avoid N+1. Defaults to `0` when no citations.
- Rate limiting: covered by the GET-exempt global safety net (Phase 49d). No endpoint-specific limiter needed.

**Phase 50b: Frontend — "Cited by N" UI — ✅ COMPLETE**

- New `annotationsAPI.getCitedBy(annotationId)` in `frontend/src/services/api.js`.
- **Collapsed card:** "Cited by N" appears inline alongside existing metadata (vote counts, concept path) when `cited_by_count > 0`. Plain text, no color, no icon — matches the "N votes" visual weight. Nothing rendered when count is 0.
- **Expanded card:** "Cited by" section renders inside the expanded area of `CorpusTabContent` annotation cards, below the existing messaging buttons and structurally parallel to the forward "Cited Annotations" section. First expand lazy-fetches via `getCitedBy(annotationId)`; result cached in `citedByMap` keyed by annotation ID. Cleared alongside forward-citations state in `closeDocumentEditor()`.
- **Click-through:** Cards call the existing `onOpenCorpusTab(corpusId, corpusName, documentId)` prop, which routes through `AppShell.handleSubscribeToCorpus`. Reuses the 409-already-subscribed handling, guest login-modal redirect, and cross-document/cross-corpus pending-document navigation infrastructure — no new code paths.
- **ConceptAnnotationPanel** and **ComboTabContent** also display the "Cited by N" indicator on flat annotation cards via the `citedByCount` field on their respective endpoints. The expanded list view is only implemented in `CorpusTabContent` (where annotation expansion already exists).
- **Deleted uploader handling:** `uploadedByUsername: null` reuses the existing "[deleted user]" convention from `ComboTabContent` line 686.

**Bug fix 1 — 409 console noise:** `handleSubscribeToCorpus` always POSTed to subscribe and relied on 409 as the "already subscribed" signal. axios logs 4xx to the console before any catch runs, so every annotation click-through produced console spam. Fixed with a local short-circuit: if `corpusTabs` already contains a tab for the corpus, skip the API call entirely and just set pending state + switch tabs. Same fix applied to `handleAnnotateFromGraph`. The 409 catch remains as a race-condition backstop for the rare case where two click-throughs fire before local state updates. Side benefit: this also silences the same 409 in Phase 27c (annotation click-through) and Phase 38h ("Add as Annotation"), which share the handler. See Architecture Decision #163 (updated).

**Bug fix 2 — stuck-on-Loading after expand:** The original implementation fired the cited-by fetch from inside `handleAnnotationClick`, which did three synchronous state updates back-to-back (`setSelectedAnnotation`, then `setCitedByMap(prev => loading)`, then the async `setCitedByMap` from the resolved fetch). The resolved update would sometimes land in a window where the JSX was still reading the `loading` snapshot, leaving the card stuck on "Loading…" until an unrelated re-render (e.g., clicking another annotation) triggered a fresh read. Fixed by moving the lazy fetch out of the click handler and into a `useEffect` keyed on `selectedAnnotation`. React owns the lifecycle now — the effect runs after commit, so state updates land in a clean render cycle. Added a `cancelled` flag in the cleanup function to abort stale fetches when the user clicks a different annotation mid-flight. The `if (citedByMap[annId]) return` guard preserves the lazy-load-once-per-card behavior. See Architecture Decision #270.

**Architecture Decision #269 — Reverse Citation Lookup Hides Dead Links (Phase 50a):** The new `/cited-by` endpoint filters out rows where `citing_document_id IS NULL` (which happens when a citing document is deleted and the FK cascades to SET NULL). This is an asymmetric choice compared to Phase 38j's forward direction, which preserves snapshot metadata and shows "(no longer available)" cards. The rationale is UX: the value of a "Cited by" entry is entirely about where you can navigate to — the citing document *is* the destination. A cited-by card with no working navigation is useless noise. Contrast with forward Cited Annotations, where the snapshot preserves the *what* of the citation (concept name, quote text) even when the *where* is broken — still informationally valuable as an artifact of what the author intended to cite. This follows Orca's append-only/never-delete principle but scopes the preservation to the direction where snapshots carry independent meaning.

**Architecture Decision #270 — Lazy Fetch Lives in useEffect, Not Click Handler (Phase 50b):** When a click handler needs to trigger an async fetch whose result feeds back into state the same component is rendering, the fetch must live in a `useEffect` keyed on the relevant state, not inside the click handler itself. Firing the fetch inline with synchronous state updates in the click handler can leave resolved async state stranded in a render cycle that already committed — the symptom is a component that appears stuck in its loading state until something else triggers a re-render. The effect pattern also enables a `cancelled` flag in the cleanup function to safely abort stale fetches when the relevant state changes mid-flight (e.g., user clicks a different annotation before the first fetch resolves). This is the preferred pattern for all future "fetch on expand" or "fetch on selection" UX in Orca. The guard `if (cachedState[key]) return` inside the effect preserves lazy-load-once behavior.

**Files touched:**
- Backend: `backend/src/routes/annotations.js` (new), `backend/src/server.js` (mount), `backend/src/controllers/corpusController.js`, `backend/src/controllers/comboController.js`, `backend/src/controllers/conceptsController.js`
- Frontend: `frontend/src/services/api.js`, `frontend/src/components/CorpusTabContent.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/ConceptAnnotationPanel.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/ComboTabContent.jsx`, `frontend/src/AppShell.jsx` (409 short-circuit)

**Commit messages:**
- `feat: 50a, reverse citation lookup backend — GET /annotations/:id/cited-by + cited_by_count on annotations payload`
- `feat: 50b, reverse citations frontend — Cited by N on annotation cards with expand-to-list and click-through navigation`
- `fix: 50b, silence 409 console noise on subscribe click-through via local tab short-circuit`
- `fix: 50b, move cited-by lazy fetch into useEffect to fix stuck-on-Loading after expand`

- **Architecture Decision #271 — No Destructive Migrations in migrate.js (April 2026 incident):** Orca's `migrate.js` has no "already applied" tracking — every statement runs on every `npm run migrate` call. This means `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements that modify existing user data will silently re-run and corrupt data. The Phase 20a and Phase 25e attribute migrations destroyed all non-value edge attributes across the entire database because they ran on every migration call. **Rule:** migrate.js must contain only idempotent, non-destructive statements (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` with `IF NOT EXISTS` guards, `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` for seed data). One-time data transformations must be run as standalone scripts, verified, and not left in the migration pipeline.

- **Architecture Decision #272 — Click-Wrap Pattern for Affirmation Modals (Phase 51):** Any modal or form that requires the user to legally affirm something (ToS acceptance, copyright affirmation, future age/jurisdiction confirmations, etc.) must use the **checkbox + disabled-button click-wrap pattern**, not a single "click this button to accept" pattern. **Rule:** (a) Affirmation text rendered as a label next to an unchecked-by-default `<input type="checkbox">`. (b) The proceed/submit button is `disabled={!affirmed}` until the checkbox is ticked, with the existing disabled visual treatment (opacity reduction + `cursor: 'not-allowed'`). (c) The affirmation state resets to `false` whenever the modal closes or a fresh submission begins — never auto-tick. (d) When the affirmation is recorded server-side (e.g., `tos_accepted_at`, `copyright_confirmed_at`), the timestamp must be set in the same DB transaction as whatever action the affirmation gates. **Why:** Browse-wrap (mere use implies acceptance) and single-button click-wrap (clicking proceed *is* the acceptance) are increasingly held unenforceable. A separate visible checkbox creates the affirmative action courts look for. Phase 51 implementation: `LoginModal.jsx` Sign Up step 3 (combined ToS + age affirmation) and the existing copyright affirmation modal both follow this pattern.

- **Architecture Decision #273 — Split-Phase Regression Windows (Phase 51 lesson):** When a feature is split across multiple commits where a backend guard depends on a frontend change (or vice versa), the user-facing flow may be fully broken between commits even though each individual commit passes its own tests in isolation. Phase 51 example: Phase 51a added the backend `tosAccepted` requirement; until Phase 51b+c shipped the frontend checkbox, registration was completely broken. **Rule:** (a) Identify split-phase pairs at planning time and flag them in the prompts. (b) Run such pairs back-to-back in the same working session when possible — avoid leaving the broken intermediate state in `main` for hours or days. (c) If the pair must span sessions, document the broken state explicitly so it isn't mistaken for a real bug during testing. (d) When in doubt, prefer adding backend guards *after* the frontend wiring, so the worst-case intermediate state is "frontend sends a field that the backend ignores" rather than "backend rejects valid-looking requests."

- **Architecture Decision #274 — Regulatory Caps That Are Permitted But Not Required (Phase 52 lesson):** Several privacy and consumer-protection statutes (Colorado Privacy Act, California CCPA/CPRA, Virginia VCDPA, etc.) follow a pattern: they grant consumers a right (e.g., data portability) AND simultaneously authorize the company to impose limits (e.g., "may decline a third request within 12 months as manifestly excessive"). When Orca implements such a cap, the cap itself is a **business decision** (typically motivated by abuse prevention or operational simplicity), not a statutory mandate. **Rule:** (a) **Implement the cap** — it's a free defensive layer with negligible user impact. (b) **Don't name the statute in user-facing UI copy.** "You can download your data up to twice per 12-month period" is honest; "The Colorado Privacy Act limits this to 2 requests per 12 months" is misleading because it implies the statute forces the cap when it merely permits it. (c) **Do name the statute in the Privacy Policy and in code comments** — that's where legal grounding belongs. (d) **Burn-the-quota timing:** when an export/request can fail mid-flight, insert the audit/quota row AFTER the operation succeeds, not before. A user whose export crashed shouldn't lose a request slot. Phase 52a follows this pattern: `INSERT INTO data_export_requests` runs only after the JSON is successfully assembled. (e) **Helper endpoint pattern:** when the frontend needs to display "X of N used" without consuming quota, expose a separate read-only endpoint (e.g., `GET /me/export-status`) that runs the same count query without the audit insert. Phase 52b ships this pattern and it's the right shape for any future regulatory cap (e.g., a hypothetical "deletion request" counter).

- **Architecture Decision #275 — Manual Email Response over Transactional Email Infrastructure for Legal Notices (Phase 53 simplification, April 28, 2026):** The original Phase 53 plan included a "Phase 53.0" prerequisite to integrate a transactional email provider (Postmark or AWS SES) and build a `sendEmail` wrapper, so that DMCA subscriber notifications (§512(g)(2)(A)) and counter-notice forwarding to complainants (§512(g)(2)(B)) could be sent automatically. **This entire layer was cut from scope.** Miles will manually respond to all infringement and counter-notice submissions from `orcaconcepts@gmail.com` using the contact information captured on the intake forms. **Rationale:** (a) Pre-launch and early-launch volume is expected to be near-zero — building automated email infrastructure for traffic that doesn't exist is premature. (b) Manual responses are *more* likely to satisfy the §512(g)(2)(A) "reasonable steps to promptly notify" standard than automated templates, because a human can adapt the language to the specific situation and demonstrate good-faith engagement. (c) Adding a transactional email provider introduces a new vendor (Privacy Policy disclosure), new credentials (env vars), new failure modes (provider downtime, deliverability), and ongoing cost — all to send what may be one or two emails per year initially. (d) The intake forms already capture submitter email; the manual reply uses the same email Miles uses for `orcaconcepts@gmail.com` correspondence, which is already monitored. **Rule:** (a) Phase 53b's admin legal-removal endpoint should return the affected user's email in its response payload so Miles can manually notify, rather than triggering a backend send. (b) The `legal_removals.user_notified_at` column stays in the schema, but is populated by a separate admin-action endpoint (or manual SQL update) after Miles confirms the email was sent — not automatically. (c) When volume warrants it (e.g., > ~10 notices/month, or if Miles is no longer the sole responder), revisit and add transactional email then. The schema design accommodates a future swap-in. (d) Maintain reply templates as snippets/SOP in a private document outside the codebase. (e) **Generalizable principle:** for any "the system sends an email to a user about a thing" feature, ask first whether manual response from a monitored inbox suffices given current volume — and only build infrastructure when manual handling becomes the bottleneck.

- **Architecture Decision #277 — Single-Service Production Deployment (Phase 54b):** In production (`NODE_ENV=production`), the backend Express app serves the built frontend from `frontend/dist` via `express.static` with a SPA fallback regex (`/^(?!\/api).*/`) that serves `index.html` for all non-API routes. This eliminates CORS in production (same origin) and allows Railway to run a single service. The SPA fallback is placed AFTER all `/api/*` routes and BEFORE the 404 handler, so API routes take precedence. The root `package.json` `start` script runs `migrate.js` before `server.js` — migrations execute on every deploy, which is safe because all migration statements use `IF NOT EXISTS` / `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` (Architecture Decision #271). In dev, the frontend is served by Vite's dev server (port 3000) with a proxy to the backend (port 5000) — the static serving code is skipped entirely.

- **Architecture Decision #278 — No File Storage Layer Needed (Phase 54a, skipped):** Documents in Orca are text-only in the database. The upload flow uses `multer.memoryStorage()` to receive file buffers, extracts text via `pdf-parse` (PDFs) and `mammoth` (DOCX) in memory, and stores only the extracted text in `documents.body` (TEXT column). No original files are written to disk or object storage. R2/S3 file storage is unnecessary unless a future feature requires storing the original uploaded files alongside the extracted text.

- **Architecture Decision #279 — DATABASE_URL Connection String with SSL Fallback (Phase 55a):** `backend/src/config/database.js` uses `process.env.DATABASE_URL` (with `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }`) when the variable is set, and falls back to individual `DB_HOST`/`DB_PORT`/`DB_USER`/`DB_PASSWORD`/`DB_NAME` env vars when it is not. This is the standard pattern for Node.js apps deployed to managed Postgres providers (Railway, Heroku, Render, Fly.io) which inject a `DATABASE_URL` connection string automatically. All production-critical files (`migrate.js`, controllers, background jobs) import the shared pool from `database.js` — never construct their own `Pool`. Local-only seed/test scripts may construct their own `Pool` with individual vars since they never run in production.

- **Architecture Decision #280 — Legal Documents Live as Static HTML Files, Not Inline JSX (Phase 56d):** Counsel-reviewed legal documents (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Copyright Policy) are stored as standalone HTML files in `frontend/public/legal/*.html`. The `TermsPage.jsx`, `PrivacyPage.jsx`, and `CopyrightPage.jsx` components fetch these files at runtime via `fetch('/legal/<filename>.html')` and render the result with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. The legal text NEVER appears inline in any `.jsx` file. **Rationale:** (a) **Wording integrity.** Legal documents have legally-meaningful exact wording. Embedding them in JSX exposes the text to multiple drift risks: JSX escaping rules for `{`/`}`/`<`/`>`, smart-quote conversion by editors, line-wrapping changes, accidental edits during unrelated refactors. Static HTML files are byte-stable assets that can be verified with hash comparison against source documents. (b) **One-file replacement for revisions.** When counsel produces a revised ToS, swapping the file is a single-file change with no source-code modifications (apart from `CURRENT_TOS_VERSION` bumps in `constants.js` for substantive changes that trigger re-acceptance). (c) **No CORS issues.** Files in `frontend/public/` are copied to `frontend/dist/` during `vite build` and served from the same origin as the SPA, so `fetch()` works without cross-origin headers. (d) **`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is appropriate here.** The "danger" warning exists for unsanitized user content; these are first-party static assets under our control. **Rule:** any document where exact wording matters legally (counsel-reviewed policies, regulatory disclosures, license texts) should follow this pattern. Conversely, informational pages whose text is editorial/marketing (Using Orca, The Storm, in-app help) can remain inline JSX since wording drift there has no legal consequence. **Verification at install:** when copying a new legal file into `frontend/public/legal/`, always verify byte-exact match against the source via MD5/SHA256 hash comparison before committing — this guards against any silent transform during the copy operation.

## Future Considerations (Unscheduled)

This section captures speculative features that are **not** on the active roadmap but are worth preserving the design thinking for. These should not be implemented until there is real demand and the prerequisites are in place. No phase numbers — these are explicitly outside the numbered phase sequence.

### Federated Ontologies / Cross-App Interoperability

**Motivation:** Orca is AGPL v3 partly to encourage others to build their own collaborative ontology apps with different rules, focuses, and communities. If that ecosystem materializes, it would be valuable for these apps to recognize when they're describing the same concept and let users hop between them. This is a "future of the open ontology web" feature, not a launch feature.

**Three problems to solve separately:**
1. **Identity** — How do two apps agree that "their concept X" and "our concept Y" are the same thing?
2. **Discovery** — How does Orca even know other apps exist and have related concepts?
3. **Navigation** — Once a link exists, how does the user actually jump between apps? (Trivially solved with a stable URL.)

**Constitutional alignment:** All federation features must preserve Orca's "transparent human action" philosophy. AI may *propose* equivalences, but humans (via votes/contestation) create them. External equivalences should be contestable, votable, permanent artifacts just like internal edges. External identifiers (e.g. Wikidata QIDs) should be *informational* rather than *authoritative* — they link out, they don't override Orca's community curation.

**Phased sketch (each phase useful on its own):**

- **Phase A — External Identifiers:** Add an optional `external_id` field to concepts (Wikidata QID, DOI, MeSH ID, etc.). No federation logic yet. Useful even with zero other apps because researchers can ground Orca concepts to canonical entities. Lays the foundation: any other app that adopts the same identifier convention gets interop "for free."

- **Phase B — Manual External Equivalence Edges:** A new edge type `external_equivalence` storing `{target_app_url, target_concept_id, target_concept_name_snapshot, creator, created_at, votes}`. Treated like any other edge — votable, contestable, permanent. Renders as an "Also in:" sidebar on the concept page with click-through links. Works with one other app.

- **Phase C — App Registry & Federation API:** A read-only public REST endpoint (e.g. `/api/v1/federation/concept/:id`) returning a standard JSON shape — concept name, attribute, path, vote counts, recent annotations. A community-maintained registry (could literally be a GitHub repo) lists compliant apps and their base URLs. Builds naturally on the public data API already planned post-launch. Requires an ecosystem to be useful.

- **Phase D — AI-Assisted Equivalence Suggestions:** Background job sends new concepts (name, path, attributes, sample annotations) to an LLM along with candidate matches from registered apps. High-confidence matches surface as suggestions: "We think this might be the same as 'Cognitive Load Theory' on LearnGraph — link it?" The user (or community) accepts or rejects. **AI proposes, humans dispose** — accepted suggestions become normal `external_equivalence` edges through the same vote/contestation mechanisms.

- **Phase E — Cross-App Search & Schema Translation:** "Show me how other apps have organized concepts under 'reinforcement learning'." LLM-assisted mapping between different attribute schemas (Orca's `[action]/[tool]/[value]` vs. another app's `[method]/[domain]/[etc]`). Only worth doing once a federation ecosystem exists.

**Implementation note — ActivityPub-inspired "lite federation":** Phase C should borrow the *ideas* from ActivityPub (the W3C decentralized social protocol behind Mastodon) without implementing the full spec. Specifically worth borrowing:
1. **Actor addressing** — `@username@instance.org` as a portable identity format. Just a convention; doesn't require the rest of the protocol.
2. **Activity documents** — Structured JSON with `{actor, verb, object, timestamp}` for events other apps should know about. Orca would extend the standard verbs (Create/Update/Like) with domain-specific ones (Propose, Vote, Annotate, Combo).
3. **Inbox/outbox pattern** — Each app exposes a public outbox feed; other apps poll or subscribe. Much simpler than ActivityPub's push-delivery model with HTTP signatures, retries, and dead-letter queues.
4. **Follow/subscription as a federated primitive** — A user on App A subscribes to a concept on App B; App A periodically fetches updates from App B's outbox. Maps cleanly onto Orca's existing subscription model.

Full ActivityPub is rejected as overkill: the spec is dense (Mastodon's implementation is tens of thousands of lines), the vocabulary is designed for social media (Notes/Articles/Likes, not concepts/edges/attributes), push delivery requires reliability infrastructure Orca doesn't need at federation scale, and the Fediverse's moderation/defederation problems are well-documented. The lite-federation model is closer to "RSS with extra verbs" than to Mastodon.

**Open questions to revisit when this becomes relevant:**
- **Trust & abuse:** Federated systems have spam/poisoning problems. A registered app could deliberately create misleading equivalences. Federation links should carry the same voting/contestation as internal edges, plus a way to mute or de-register bad-actor apps.
- **Constitutional tension on external IDs:** Even informational external IDs (Wikidata, etc.) are a soft form of deferring to external curation. Worth being explicit in the constitution about whether/how this is allowed before implementing Phase A.
- **AGPL implications for compatibility:** Forks of Orca will have schema compatibility for free. Independent reimplementations will need a real spec — another reason a federation API spec (Phase C) is valuable even if no one is using it yet.
- **ORCID precedent:** The existing ORCID integration (Phase 41) is already a small step in this direction — Orca defers to an external authority for researcher identity. Federated concept identity is the same pattern applied to concepts instead of people. Worth treating ORCID as the design precedent when this work begins.

**Prerequisites before any of this is worth starting:**
- Orca is launched and has real users.
- The public data API (post-launch roadmap item) is built and stable.
- At least one other ontology app exists that wants to interoperate, OR researchers are actively asking for Wikidata grounding.

## Design Philosophy

The visual interface pursues minimalism and Zen aesthetics. The background is a soft off-white and text is black in EB Garamond serif font (loaded via Google Fonts, with explicit `fontFamily` set on all interactive elements). The only color comes from the identical vote set swatches and dots; all other buttons use the black-on-off-white theme with neutral borders. No emoji icons in UI chrome — replaced with text labels (only ▲ vote and ⇄ swap retained as geometric symbols; plain Unicode ←→▸▾✕↓ kept as simple shapes). No italics anywhere in the UI. No colored buttons (green, red, blue all converted to transparent/dark with neutral borders in Phase 28a).

## My Claude Preferences
I want to move safely and use git versioning to avoid big mistakes with code editing. I want you to prompt me when I should consider a commit to git. I also want you to prompt me to make updates to this markdown file when it makes sense. If you think a bug is worth documenting to avoid similar things in the future, for example.

## Questions to Ask When Stuck

1. "What does the backend error log say?"
2. "What does the frontend console show?"
3. "What's the PostgreSQL query returning?" (use pgAdmin to test)
4. "Is the .env file loaded?" (add console.log to check)
5. "Are both servers running?"
